Following the death of the previous sultan, Zanzibari Prince Khālid ibn Barghash refused to accept the British Empire’s preferred successor and instead occupied the sultan’s palace, which prompted imperial cruisers to fire on his position. The war lasted no longer than 40 minutes, making it the shortest war in recorded history.\n Context\nIn the late 19th century, Britain’s extended its influence over East Africa in general and Zanzibar in particular. While SayyidSaʿīd ibn Sulṭān had expanded Zanzibar’s regional holdings and global mercantile importance in the first half the century, his successor Barghash was forced to bend to European powers and partition his land among the British and the Germans; later sultans followed suit. By 1890 Britain had convinced the sultanate to cede its mainland territories to Germany while allowing the island itself to become a protectorate of the British Empire. Britain agreed to preserve the sultanate as an institution, but it stressed that the power of the sultan was nominal.\n What was the shortest war in history? An episode of Breaking Bad has a longer run time than the Anglo-Zanzibar War.\n Upon becoming Zanzibar’s protector, Britain outlined two key policy goals: the abolition of slavery and the restoration of the island’s strong mercantile economy. Consul General Gerald Portal’s economic policy angered the Zanzibari merchants, but what angered them more was the policy on slavery, which had become integral to their way of life as spice plantations surged in value throughout the 19th century. Sayyid Ali ibn Saʿīd resisted Britain’s directives until his death in 1893, and, when it came time to choose his successor, Britain voiced its expectation that the next sultan be more submissive to imperial authority. Out of the several claimants to the throne, the British backed Ḥamad ibn Thuwayn.", "date": "2019-09-17"}, {"doc_id": "d2", "title": "Holy cow! history: Ready, set, surrender!

It lasted less than 40 minutes.\n The East African island of Zanzibar had come under the control of the British Empire just a few years before. Britain had two goals for its new protectorate: abolish slavery there and fix the economy.\n Britain had agreed to keep the existing sultanate in place, but the sultan’s power was diminished by Zanzibar’s treaty with Britain.\n British officials soon found some sultans to be more receptive toward their agenda than others. During the 1890s the British government tried to install a ruler who would support abolition: a tough ask in Zanzibar, where the economy was built on the spice trade and ending slavery meant earning the ire of many of the richest members of the population.\n Ḥamad ibn Thuwayn was made sultan in 1893. Ḥamad was seen as a puppet of the British Empire. He ruled peacefully until his death in 1896. Speculation persists that his sudden death may have been murder on the part of his nephew, Prince Khālid ibn Barghash.\n After Ḥamad’s untimely demise, Prince Khālid—who had been passed over as sultan twice already—claimed the palace (and its harem). He assembled an army of more than 2,800 men, artillery, and an armed yacht.\n The British warned Khālid that they would take military action if he did not vacate the palace by 9:00 AM on August 27th.\n Prince Khālid defied the order. British warships opened fire at 9:00 AM as promised. Within two minutes the majority of Khālid’s artillery was destroyed.\n The forces of the prince fought on for nearly 40 more minutes: they suffered 500 casualties by the time the onslaught halted.", "date": "Aug 5, 2024"}, {"doc_id": "d4", "title": "How Long Was The 1896 Anglo-Zanzibar War? - HistoryExtra", "url": "https://www.historyextra.com/period/victorian/shortest-war-history/", "snippet": "The Anglo-Zanzibar War of 1896 will never be considered one of the world’s significant conflicts; it wasn’t even the biggest for the British during that decade, with the Second Boer War coming a few years later. But it does hold a distinct honour: it is the shortest war ever recorded in history.\n Advertisement\nWhy is the Anglo-Zanzibar War the shortest war in history?\n Fought on 27 August 1896 between the British empire and the Sultanate of Zanzibar, the whole thing lasted around 38 minutes.\n It ended with a complete victory for the British, who cemented their position in Zanzibar for decades to come. The war’s brevity, however, belied the complex geopolitics that led to its outbreak in the first place.\n What was the background to the Anglo-Zanzibar War?\nZanzibar, an archipelago off the East African coast of modern-day Tanzania, was a strategic hub in the Indian Ocean, rich in resources and a crossroads for trade routes. By 1890, it had become a British protectorate, meaning that while the sultan remained a figurehead it was the British empire that wielded political and military control.\n Britain’s interests in Zanzibar were primarily driven by trade concerns, which had to be placed in the wider context of imperialist competition with other European colonial powers in Africa, notably the German empire. The islands had proven to be crucial for controlling shipping lanes from British India to Europe.\n Moreover, the British had launched a campaign to suppress the East African slave trade, motivated by both humanitarian and imperialist purposes, and Zanzibar had long been a major trafficking centre.\n What caused the Anglo-Zanzibar War to break out?\n The catalyst for the war was the death of the pro-British sultan, Hamad bin Thuwaini, in August 1896. While not confirmed, he was almost certainly poisoned by his cousin, Khālid ibn Barghash, who then hastily declared himself the new sultan.", "date": "Nov 26, 2024"}, {"doc_id": "d5", "title": "The shortest war in history: The Anglo-Zanzibar War of 1896", "url": "https://www.history.org.uk/publications/resource/7950/the-shortest-war-in-history-the-anglo-zanzibar-wa", "snippet": "The shortest war in history: The Anglo-Zanzibar War of 1896\nAt 9am on 27 August 1896, following an ultimatum, five ships of the Royal Navy began a bombardment of the Royal Palace and Harem in Zanzibar.

Over 500 defenders died, compared to one British marine who was injured. Thus ended what is widely regarded as the ‘shortest war in history.'\n The immediate cause of the war was the death of the Sultan of Zanzibar, Hamad bin Thuwaini on the 25 August. His nephew, Khalid bin Bargash, seized power, but he was regarded by the British as far too independent. They preferred Hamud bin Muhammed. In the best tradition of gunboat diplomacy, an ultimatum was issued at 8am, giving Khalid an hour to surrender and leave the palace. When the ultimatum expired the bombardment began, and a force of marines was landed on the shore. As the shells landed, Khalid bin Bargash fled the palace seeking safety in the German consulate, from which he was quickly and in secret shipped out of the country. Order was restored and Britain's preferred ruler Hamud bin Muhammed was installed as Sultan of Zanzibar where he ruled, with British assistance, until his death in 1902.

The first prize in 1901 was reported in hundreds of newspapers in different parts of the world.[48] The prizes to Rudyard Kipling in 1907 and Rabindranath Tagore in 1913 helped to establish the prize as a central phenomenon in world literature. After the second world war the prize has earned more intense media attention with dramatic news reports and in-depth comments from around the world, further establishing its central position in the world literature space.[48] Days before the announcement of the year's nobel laurete in literature possible winners are widely guessed in the media, and controversial and surprise choices has often caused much media discussion.[48]\nCriticism\nAlthough the Nobel Prize in Literature has become the world's most prestigious literature prize,[49] the Swedish Academy has attracted significant criticism for its handling of the award. Many authors who have won the prize have fallen into obscurity, while others rejected by the jury remain widely studied and read. In the Wall Street Journal, Joseph Epstein wrote, \"You might not know it, but you and I are members of a club whose fellow members include Leo Tolstoy, Henry James, Anton Chekhov, Mark Twain, Henrik Ibsen, Marcel Proust, James Joyce, Jorge Luis Borges and Vladimir Nabokov. The club is the Non-Winners of the Nobel Prize in Literature. All these authentically great writers, still alive when the prize, initiated in 1901, was being awarded, didn't win it. \"[50] Other notable names from the non-western canon who were ignored despite being nominated several times for the prize include Sri Aurobindo and Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan. The prize has \"become widely seen as a political one – a peace prize in literary disguise\", whose judges are prejudiced against authors with political tastes different from theirs.[51]Tim Parks has expressed skepticism that it is possible for \"Swedish professors ...

Likewise, his cosmopolitan aspirations made him an advocate of peace and of the brotherhood of nations. In his will he also included literature, although he placed it after the sciences, to which he felt most drawn.\n Literature is grateful to him that its practitioners have also been the object of his solicitude; one could argue that it comes last in the group of Swedish prizes for the very sound reason that the supreme flower of civilization, perhaps most beautiful yet also most delicate, will now bloom on the firm ground of reality.\n In any event, the laureates receive in these floral tributes of modern times a recompense surpassing in material value the golden violets of a past era.\n The award of the Nobel Prize in Literature poses its own problems. «Literature» is a very inclusive term and the statutes of the Nobel Foundation rightly specify that the competition must include not only belles-lettres but also works which, by their form as well as by their exposition, have literary value. But thereby the field is expanded and the difficulties are compounded. If it is difficult to decide – supposing that the merits of the proposed authors otherwise are approximately equal – whether the Prize should be granted to a lyric, an epic, or a dramatic poet, the task is complicated even more if it becomes a matter of choosing among an eminent historian, a great philosopher, and a poet of genius. The dimensions become, as the mathematicians say, incommensurable. But one may be consoled with the thought that, since the Prize is an annual one, more than one writer of merit who has to yield his place to another equally great, may be able to receive some other year the award he deserves.\n Numerous and excellent recommendations for the literary Prize have reached the Swedish Academy.", "date": "2025-04-03"}, {"doc_id": "d3", "title": "All Nobel Prizes in Literature - NobelPrize.org", "url": "https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/lists/all-nobel-prizes-in-literature/", "snippet": "The Nobel Prize in Literature has been awarded 117 times to 121 Nobel Prize laureates between 1901 and 2024.

Around that time, one of Nobel’s brothers died in France, and French newspapers printed obituaries in which they mistook him for Alfred. One headline read, “The merchant of death is dead.” Alfred Nobel in fact had pacifist tendencies and in his later years apparently developed strong misgivings about the impact of his inventions on the world. After he died in San Remo, Italy, on December 10, 1896, the majority of his estate went toward the creation of prizes to be given annually in the fields of physics, chemistry, medicine, literature, and peace. The portion of his will establishing the Nobel Peace Prize read, “[one award shall be given] to the person who has done the most or best work for fraternity among nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies, and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses.” Exactly five years after his death, the first Nobel awards were presented.\n Today, the Nobel Prizes are regarded as the most prestigious awards in the world in their various fields.

On that day, Folke Henschen told radio listeners his personal memories of the very first Nobel Prize awards, which he experienced as a student marshal. What follows here is a more detailed version.\n After long protracted negotiations, partly with the French government (which sought to impose a very hefty tax on the Nobel estate) and partly with the Nobel family, the first awarding of five Nobel Prizes could finally take place on 10 December 1901 – four of them given out in Stockholm and one, the Peace Prize, in Christiania, as Oslo was then called. Five years had passed since Alfred Nobel had died in San Remo, on 10 December 1896.\n In the days leading up to the awarding of prizes, there was certain tension in the air. The Nobel Laureates’ names had been kept secret – they were not, as now, revealed months in advance. When three distinguished German – speaking gentlemen arrived by train from the south and were taken to the Grand Hotel, it was clear that they must be the Nobel Laureates. International traffic was not as commonplace then as now.\n Photo of Folke Henschen kindly provided by his son, Anders Henschen.\n The Nobel Prizes were presented in the large hall of the Royal Swedish Academy of Music1 at Nybroviken. The unpretentious, rather boring hall had been richly decorated under the supervision of the much sought-after royal architect, Agi Lindegren. As one of the so-called student marshals, decked out in student cap and a broad silk blue-and-gold band over my left shoulder, I had an excellent view of everything from my seat in the gallery to the right of the podium. The large bandstand where the royal orchestra was to play was completely decorated with plants and pine boughs.

Often likened to Franz Kafka, Can’s experimental style transforms the mundane into the surreal.\n The academy is known for its penchant for bringing lesser-known authors to a wider audience. “I think they’ve gone to great pains to find some writer that will catch the culture commentariat with their pants down,” Bjorn Wiman, culture editor at Sweden’s newspaper of record, Dagens Nyheter, said.\n That was the case in 2021, when Zanzibar-born British author Abdulrazak Gurnah was chosen for his work exploring exile, colonialism and racism, and in 2016 when US folk-rock icon Bob Dylan won. Wiman said the prize could just as easily go to a Mexican or Argentinian writer as an African author. “I think it will be a woman from a language zone outside Europe,” he said.\n His personal pick would however be British Indian-born author Salman Rushdie—a symbol of free speech after receiving death threats over his 1988 novel The Satanic Verses which was declared blasphemous by Iran’s Supreme Leader, and the victim of a 2022 stabbing in New York State that saw him lose his right eye.", "date": "2024-10-08 00:00:00"}], "notes": [{"doc_id": "d1", "verdict": "supports", "key_fact": "The Nobel Prize for Literature was first awarded in the year 1901.", "quote": ""}, {"doc_id": "d2", "verdict": "supports", "key_fact": "The 1st Nobel Prize for Literature was awarded on December 10, 1901.", "quote": ""}, {"doc_id": "d3", "verdict": "supports", "key_fact": "", "quote": ""}, {"doc_id": "d4", "verdict": "supports", "key_fact": "The 1st Nobel Prize for Literature was awarded in the year 1901.
