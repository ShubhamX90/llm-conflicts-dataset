Following the death of the previous sultan, Zanzibari Prince Khālid ibn Barghash refused to accept the British Empire’s preferred successor and instead occupied the sultan’s palace, which prompted imperial cruisers to fire on his position. The war lasted no longer than 40 minutes, making it the shortest war in recorded history.\n Context\nIn the late 19th century, Britain’s extended its influence over East Africa in general and Zanzibar in particular. While SayyidSaʿīd ibn Sulṭān had expanded Zanzibar’s regional holdings and global mercantile importance in the first half the century, his successor Barghash was forced to bend to European powers and partition his land among the British and the Germans; later sultans followed suit. By 1890 Britain had convinced the sultanate to cede its mainland territories to Germany while allowing the island itself to become a protectorate of the British Empire. Britain agreed to preserve the sultanate as an institution, but it stressed that the power of the sultan was nominal.\n What was the shortest war in history? An episode of Breaking Bad has a longer run time than the Anglo-Zanzibar War.\n Upon becoming Zanzibar’s protector, Britain outlined two key policy goals: the abolition of slavery and the restoration of the island’s strong mercantile economy. Consul General Gerald Portal’s economic policy angered the Zanzibari merchants, but what angered them more was the policy on slavery, which had become integral to their way of life as spice plantations surged in value throughout the 19th century. Sayyid Ali ibn Saʿīd resisted Britain’s directives until his death in 1893, and, when it came time to choose his successor, Britain voiced its expectation that the next sultan be more submissive to imperial authority. Out of the several claimants to the throne, the British backed Ḥamad ibn Thuwayn.", "date": "2019-09-17"}, {"doc_id": "d2", "title": "Holy cow! history: Ready, set, surrender!

It lasted less than 40 minutes.\n The East African island of Zanzibar had come under the control of the British Empire just a few years before. Britain had two goals for its new protectorate: abolish slavery there and fix the economy.\n Britain had agreed to keep the existing sultanate in place, but the sultan’s power was diminished by Zanzibar’s treaty with Britain.\n British officials soon found some sultans to be more receptive toward their agenda than others. During the 1890s the British government tried to install a ruler who would support abolition: a tough ask in Zanzibar, where the economy was built on the spice trade and ending slavery meant earning the ire of many of the richest members of the population.\n Ḥamad ibn Thuwayn was made sultan in 1893. Ḥamad was seen as a puppet of the British Empire. He ruled peacefully until his death in 1896. Speculation persists that his sudden death may have been murder on the part of his nephew, Prince Khālid ibn Barghash.\n After Ḥamad’s untimely demise, Prince Khālid—who had been passed over as sultan twice already—claimed the palace (and its harem). He assembled an army of more than 2,800 men, artillery, and an armed yacht.\n The British warned Khālid that they would take military action if he did not vacate the palace by 9:00 AM on August 27th.\n Prince Khālid defied the order. British warships opened fire at 9:00 AM as promised. Within two minutes the majority of Khālid’s artillery was destroyed.\n The forces of the prince fought on for nearly 40 more minutes: they suffered 500 casualties by the time the onslaught halted.", "date": "Aug 5, 2024"}, {"doc_id": "d4", "title": "How Long Was The 1896 Anglo-Zanzibar War? - HistoryExtra", "url": "https://www.historyextra.com/period/victorian/shortest-war-history/", "snippet": "The Anglo-Zanzibar War of 1896 will never be considered one of the world’s significant conflicts; it wasn’t even the biggest for the British during that decade, with the Second Boer War coming a few years later. But it does hold a distinct honour: it is the shortest war ever recorded in history.\n Advertisement\nWhy is the Anglo-Zanzibar War the shortest war in history?\n Fought on 27 August 1896 between the British empire and the Sultanate of Zanzibar, the whole thing lasted around 38 minutes.\n It ended with a complete victory for the British, who cemented their position in Zanzibar for decades to come. The war’s brevity, however, belied the complex geopolitics that led to its outbreak in the first place.\n What was the background to the Anglo-Zanzibar War?\nZanzibar, an archipelago off the East African coast of modern-day Tanzania, was a strategic hub in the Indian Ocean, rich in resources and a crossroads for trade routes. By 1890, it had become a British protectorate, meaning that while the sultan remained a figurehead it was the British empire that wielded political and military control.\n Britain’s interests in Zanzibar were primarily driven by trade concerns, which had to be placed in the wider context of imperialist competition with other European colonial powers in Africa, notably the German empire. The islands had proven to be crucial for controlling shipping lanes from British India to Europe.\n Moreover, the British had launched a campaign to suppress the East African slave trade, motivated by both humanitarian and imperialist purposes, and Zanzibar had long been a major trafficking centre.\n What caused the Anglo-Zanzibar War to break out?\n The catalyst for the war was the death of the pro-British sultan, Hamad bin Thuwaini, in August 1896. While not confirmed, he was almost certainly poisoned by his cousin, Khālid ibn Barghash, who then hastily declared himself the new sultan.", "date": "Nov 26, 2024"}, {"doc_id": "d5", "title": "The shortest war in history: The Anglo-Zanzibar War of 1896", "url": "https://www.history.org.uk/publications/resource/7950/the-shortest-war-in-history-the-anglo-zanzibar-wa", "snippet": "The shortest war in history: The Anglo-Zanzibar War of 1896\nAt 9am on 27 August 1896, following an ultimatum, five ships of the Royal Navy began a bombardment of the Royal Palace and Harem in Zanzibar.

Over 500 defenders died, compared to one British marine who was injured. Thus ended what is widely regarded as the ‘shortest war in history.'\n The immediate cause of the war was the death of the Sultan of Zanzibar, Hamad bin Thuwaini on the 25 August. His nephew, Khalid bin Bargash, seized power, but he was regarded by the British as far too independent. They preferred Hamud bin Muhammed. In the best tradition of gunboat diplomacy, an ultimatum was issued at 8am, giving Khalid an hour to surrender and leave the palace. When the ultimatum expired the bombardment began, and a force of marines was landed on the shore. As the shells landed, Khalid bin Bargash fled the palace seeking safety in the German consulate, from which he was quickly and in secret shipped out of the country. Order was restored and Britain's preferred ruler Hamud bin Muhammed was installed as Sultan of Zanzibar where he ruled, with British assistance, until his death in 1902.

Neighbouring areas have Jain temples known as basadis and several images of the Tirthankaras. Vindyagiri Hill is one of the two hills in Shravanabelagola.

The first prize in 1901 was reported in hundreds of newspapers in different parts of the world.[48] The prizes to Rudyard Kipling in 1907 and Rabindranath Tagore in 1913 helped to establish the prize as a central phenomenon in world literature. After the second world war the prize has earned more intense media attention with dramatic news reports and in-depth comments from around the world, further establishing its central position in the world literature space.[48] Days before the announcement of the year's nobel laurete in literature possible winners are widely guessed in the media, and controversial and surprise choices has often caused much media discussion.[48]\nCriticism\nAlthough the Nobel Prize in Literature has become the world's most prestigious literature prize,[49] the Swedish Academy has attracted significant criticism for its handling of the award. Many authors who have won the prize have fallen into obscurity, while others rejected by the jury remain widely studied and read. In the Wall Street Journal, Joseph Epstein wrote, \"You might not know it, but you and I are members of a club whose fellow members include Leo Tolstoy, Henry James, Anton Chekhov, Mark Twain, Henrik Ibsen, Marcel Proust, James Joyce, Jorge Luis Borges and Vladimir Nabokov. The club is the Non-Winners of the Nobel Prize in Literature. All these authentically great writers, still alive when the prize, initiated in 1901, was being awarded, didn't win it. \"[50] Other notable names from the non-western canon who were ignored despite being nominated several times for the prize include Sri Aurobindo and Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan.

Likewise, his cosmopolitan aspirations made him an advocate of peace and of the brotherhood of nations. In his will he also included literature, although he placed it after the sciences, to which he felt most drawn.\n Literature is grateful to him that its practitioners have also been the object of his solicitude; one could argue that it comes last in the group of Swedish prizes for the very sound reason that the supreme flower of civilization, perhaps most beautiful yet also most delicate, will now bloom on the firm ground of reality.\n In any event, the laureates receive in these floral tributes of modern times a recompense surpassing in material value the golden violets of a past era.\n The award of the Nobel Prize in Literature poses its own problems. «Literature» is a very inclusive term and the statutes of the Nobel Foundation rightly specify that the competition must include not only belles-lettres but also works which, by their form as well as by their exposition, have literary value. But thereby the field is expanded and the difficulties are compounded. If it is difficult to decide – supposing that the merits of the proposed authors otherwise are approximately equal – whether the Prize should be granted to a lyric, an epic, or a dramatic poet, the task is complicated even more if it becomes a matter of choosing among an eminent historian, a great philosopher, and a poet of genius. The dimensions become, as the mathematicians say, incommensurable. But one may be consoled with the thought that, since the Prize is an annual one, more than one writer of merit who has to yield his place to another equally great, may be able to receive some other year the award he deserves.\n Numerous and excellent recommendations for the literary Prize have reached the Swedish Academy.", "date": "2025-04-03"}, {"doc_id": "d3", "title": "All Nobel Prizes in Literature - NobelPrize.org", "url": "https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/lists/all-nobel-prizes-in-literature/", "snippet": "The Nobel Prize in Literature has been awarded 117 times to 121 Nobel Prize laureates between 1901 and 2024.

Around that time, one of Nobel’s brothers died in France, and French newspapers printed obituaries in which they mistook him for Alfred. One headline read, “The merchant of death is dead.” Alfred Nobel in fact had pacifist tendencies and in his later years apparently developed strong misgivings about the impact of his inventions on the world. After he died in San Remo, Italy, on December 10, 1896, the majority of his estate went toward the creation of prizes to be given annually in the fields of physics, chemistry, medicine, literature, and peace. The portion of his will establishing the Nobel Peace Prize read, “[one award shall be given] to the person who has done the most or best work for fraternity among nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies, and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses.” Exactly five years after his death, the first Nobel awards were presented.\n Today, the Nobel Prizes are regarded as the most prestigious awards in the world in their various fields.

On that day, Folke Henschen told radio listeners his personal memories of the very first Nobel Prize awards, which he experienced as a student marshal. What follows here is a more detailed version.\n After long protracted negotiations, partly with the French government (which sought to impose a very hefty tax on the Nobel estate) and partly with the Nobel family, the first awarding of five Nobel Prizes could finally take place on 10 December 1901 – four of them given out in Stockholm and one, the Peace Prize, in Christiania, as Oslo was then called. Five years had passed since Alfred Nobel had died in San Remo, on 10 December 1896.\n In the days leading up to the awarding of prizes, there was certain tension in the air. The Nobel Laureates’ names had been kept secret – they were not, as now, revealed months in advance. When three distinguished German – speaking gentlemen arrived by train from the south and were taken to the Grand Hotel, it was clear that they must be the Nobel Laureates.

In his last will Nobel declared that the whole of his remaining fortune of 31, 5 million Swedish crowns was to be invested in safe securities and should constitute a fund \"the interest on which shall be annually distributed in the form of prizes to those who, during the preceding year, shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind\"\nWill\nThe will specified in which fields the prizes should be awarded – physics, chemistry, medicine or physiology, literature and peace – and which criteria the respective prize committees should apply when choosing their prize recipients. According to the will the Nobel Peace Prize was to be awarded “to the person who shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between the nations and the abolition or reduction of standing armies and the formation and spreading of peace congresses.”\nNorwegian Nobel Committee\nAlfred Nobel’s will declared that the Nobel Peace Prize was to be awarded by a committee of five persons selected by the Norwegian Storting (parliament). The Storting accepted the assignment in April 1897, and the Nobel Committee of the Norwegian Storting was set up in August of the same year.

Wiman said the prize could just as easily go to a Mexican or Argentinian writer as an African author. “I think it will be a woman from a language zone outside Europe,” he said.\n His personal pick would however be British Indian-born author Salman Rushdie—a symbol of free speech after receiving death threats over his 1988 novel The Satanic Verses which was declared blasphemous by Iran’s Supreme Leader, and the victim of a 2022 stabbing in New York State that saw him lose his right eye.", "date": "2024-10-08 00:00:00"}]}

This went into action in the Battle of Loos in September 1915 and in the first Battle of the Somme on July 1st 1916. The transmitting portion of set was based on the design of the No 1 Aircraft Spark set. The receiving portion used a carborundum crystal detector. It was powered from an accumulator and also required dry-cell batteries for biasing the carborundum crystal and an internal test buzzer.\n Its range was 3.7km with aerials mounted on masts but this reduced to 1.1km when the aerial was run close to the ground.\n Careful planning of frequencies was required in order to minimize interference from neighbouring spark transmitters, a problem much simplified when CW sets came into use.\n The BF set was used extensively during the second half of the war and approximately 1200 were manufactured.\n 130-watt Wilson Trench Set & Short Wave Tuner Mk. III\nThe Wilson Transmitter was used primarily for Division to Corps communication and Corps Directing Station. This set came into service about the same time as the BF Trench Set. It had a fixed spark gap with a motor-driven, high-speed interrupter rather than the slower magnetic interrupter. The greater number of sparks produced a musical note in the headphones, making the Morse signal more easy to hear through interference. The transmitter had the same frequencies as the BF set and the higher power meant that the range was up to 8.3km.

The telephone, telegraph and the appearance of effective wireless radio sets were replacing older communication methods. The article in Scientific American from March 17, 1917, says:\n“With an army strung out over miles of irregular trenches prompt communication by the older method is obviously impossible, although special instructions carried by fast motorcycles have been found greatly superior to the old horse-mounted messengers; but where rapid communication with the commanders of long lines of trenches, and numerous widely scattered batteries of guns, is necessary something vastly more prompt and certain is required, and in this emergency recourse is had to the telephone, which has proved to be indispensable. By means of telephones, operated through heavily insulated wires that can be run rapidly from point to point, resting directly upon the ground without any supports or elaborate fixtures, orders may be transmitted along miles of trenches within a few minutes, where flags could not be seen, and where messengers even on the fastest motorcycles would require hours, even if they got through safely at all, thus enabling rapid cooperative action to be taken, or special advances organized and properly supported both by troops and guns.”\n A German field telephone setup—portable of course—from 1914. Credit: Scientific American, December 19, 1914\nArtillery, though, frequently cut telephone wires, so “runners” carrying messages back and forth were widely used. As warfare became more mobile late in the war, static telephone lines became less useful, while radios were becoming more portable.

These were adapted to fit the needs of British soldiers in the trenches and ranged from modified cavalry field radios to field communication devices for gun spotters.\n This improved telecommunications equipment made it easier for troops and officers to get information up and down the chain of command; from forces headquarters to the front line and back. One important piece of apparatus for sending intelligence and operational updates was the portable morse code machine, used by the British army throughout the conflict and often in trench holes at the heart of the battle.\n During this period, work was also being done to improve the military’s ability to attack and defend. One of these techniques was sound ranging, a process that uses sound to work out the position and coordinates of enemy artillery firing – you can see the devices used to conduct experiments into sound ranging below in fascinating photographs from the Ministry of Aviation.

Telephones were reliable, but their long, strung-out wires were vulnerable to shellfire and frequently cut. Burying the lines deep into the ground was labour intensive and time consuming, and still did not always protect against shellfire. Pigeons were surprisingly effective in carrying messages, but required special handlers and could become disoriented by the noise of artillery barrages.\n Bulky and Fragile Radios\nWireless telegraphy (radio) could transmit Morse code in 1914, but the wireless sets were bulky and fragile, with relatively short ranges. Later, more robust wireless sets were used by observers to direct artillery fire.\n Limited Communication with Aircraft\nAircraft flew “contact patrols” to observe the forward movement of troops. They were only fitted with transmitting wireless sets, as receivers added too much weight to the airframe. Aircraft could also drop messages near a headquarters or friendly position. Troops on the ground used various methods, such as signal lamps, panels, and flares, to send messages to aircraft.\n Unresolved Problems\nDespite these tools, communication often broke down between the attacking infantry and their headquarters in the rear. When this happened, commanders did not know the location of their troops and were unable to support them with accurate artillery fire, ammunition, or supplies.

This led all the belligerents to develop and use radio (wireless) as an alternate means of communication. Prewar radio sets were too heavy and bulky to be taken into the trenches, and they also required large and highly visible aerials. Radio engineers of the belligerent nations soon developed smaller and more portable sets powered by storage batteries and using low, inconspicuous aerials. Although radio equipment came to be issued to the headquarters of all units, including battalions, the ease of enemy interception, the requirements for cryptographing or encoding messages, and the inherent unreliability of these early systems caused them to be regarded as strictly auxiliary to the wire system and reserved for emergency use when the wire lines were cut. Visual signaling returned to the battlefield in World War I with the use of electric signal lamps. Pyrotechnics, rockets, Very pistols, and flares had a wide use for transmitting prearranged signals. Messenger service came to be highly developed, and motorcycle, bicycle, and automobile messenger service was employed. Homing pigeons were used extensively as one-way messengers from front to rear and acquitted themselves extremely well. Dogs were also used as messengers and, in the German army, reached a high degree of efficiency.\n A new element in warfare, the airplane, introduced in World War I, immediately posed a problem in communication. During most of the war, communication between ground and air was difficult and elementary. To make his reports the pilot had to land or drop messages, and he received instructions while in the air from strips of white and black cloth called “panels” laid out in an open field according to prearranged designs.

The primary functions of the office are to preside over the Supreme Court in its public sessions when the Court is hearing arguments and during its private conferences when it is discussing and deciding cases. Chief justices serve as chair of the Court and have authority to assign the writing of opinions when they are members of the majority; otherwise their powers are the same as those of other Supreme Court justices. The chief justice customarily administers the oath of office to the president and vice president at the time of their inauguration. The chief justice is also the presiding officer of the Judicial Conference of the United States, an assembly of judges representing all the federal courts that reviews and investigates problems relating to the administration of justice in those courts.\n When the office is occupied by a person of extraordinary intellectual capacity and dynamic personality, as was the case with John Marshall (served 1801–35), the chief justice may exert a great influence on the court’s work. Occupants of the centre chair who are lesser figures are likely to be overshadowed by other members of the court.\n The title of chief justice is also usually accorded to the presiding judicial officer within any multi-judge court, as well as to the highest judicial officer within a state of the United States. In the United Kingdom the title of lord chief justice is held by the officer presiding over the judiciary of England and Wales.", "date": "2025-03-04 00:00:00"}]}

The scape is partly hidden within the leaf sheath.[4] Spanish moss propagates both by seed and vegetatively by fragments that are carried on the wind and stick to tree limbs or that are carried to other locations by birds as nesting material.[citation needed]\nSpanish moss is in the family Bromeliaceae (the bromeliads). Formerly, it was placed in the genera Anoplophytum, Caraguata, and Renealmia.[8] The specific name of the plant, usneoides, means \"resembling Usnea\", a lichen.[9]\nSpanish moss is not parasitic: it is an epiphyte that absorbs nutrients and water through its own leaves from the air and rain falling upon it. While its presence rarely kills the trees on which it grows, it occasionally becomes so thick that, by shading the leaves of the tree, it slows the growth rate of the tree.[6] It can use the water-conserving strategy of crassulacean acid metabolism for photosynthesis.[16][17]\nSpanish moss shelters a number of creatures, including rat snakes and three species of bats. One species of jumping spider, Pelegrina tillandsiae, has been found only on Spanish moss.[19] Although widely presumed to infest Spanish moss, in one study of the ecology of the plant, chiggers were not present among thousands of other arthropods identified on the plant.[20]\nSpanish moss is sensitive to airborne contaminants. It does not grow in areas where smoke is common, such as near chimneys. It has receded from urban areas due to increasing air pollution.[6]\nOne anecdote about the origin of Spanish moss is called \"the Meanest Man Who Ever Lived\", in which the man's white hair grew very long and got caught on trees.[21]\nSpanish moss was introduced to Hawaii in the nineteenth century. It became a popular ornamental and lei plant.[15]", "date": "NA"}, {"doc_id": "d2", "title": "Garden Q&A: Amount, not presence, of Spanish moss is the real issue", "url": "https://www.jacksonville.com/story/entertainment/local/2011/04/02/garden-qa-amount-not-presence-spanish-moss-real-issue/15908769007/", "snippet": "Garden Q&A: Amount, not presence, of Spanish moss is the real issue\nMy friend says Spanish moss is a parasite and should be removed from shrubs and trees. I say leave it alone. What do you say?\nMany people mistakenly think that Spanish moss is a parasite and should be removed from landscape plants, but you are correct, it is not a parasite as it does not obtain its nutrition from trees or other plants.\n Spanish moss, Tillandsea usneoides, also called Florida moss, long moss and graybeard is not a true moss. It is an epiphyte, a type of air plant that makes its own food by catching moisture and nutrients from the air.\n There is a caveat here. Too much moss can cause problems for shrubs and trees. If plants become overloaded with moss, the photosynthesis process of the leaves is reduced. This can affect the long term health of plants. Also, excessive moss can weigh down and break branches.\n If you are concerned that any of your shrubs or trees has an excessive amount of moss, you can start by removing the reachable pieces.\n If you are concerned about the presence of moss in large trees, you might want to consult with a certified arborist to see if further action is warranted.\n My Valencia orange tree is loaded with fruit. When is the best time to pick the oranges for juicing?\nValencias are a late season fruit, meaning their harvest time comes at a later date than much of the citrus that we grow here in Northeast Florida. Because of their late maturity, which can subject the fruit to potential freeze damage, we generally don't recommend planting them here. Fortunately for you, it looks like you have found a micro-climate where you are successfully growing Valencias.\n According to the publication \"Citrus Culture in the Home Landscape,\" they can be harvested from March to June. In the southern part of the state, the harvest period is longer.\n Valencias tend to turn golden when they ripen.

It’s often found in swamps and rainforests, and near ponds, streams and lakes.\n description\nNo soil needed\nSpanish moss doesn’t grow from the ground. In fact, it doesn’t have roots. It clings to tree branches and hangs down like a hairy beard. A plant that grows on a different plant is called an epiphyte (rhymes with “peppy fight”). It isn’t a parasite, though. It takes nutrients and water from its surroundings and doesn’t harm the tree.\n New plants\nThe seeds of Spanish moss float through the air like dandelion seeds. If they land on another tree, they grow. But Spanish moss can start a new plant in another way too. Sometimes, parts of it break off. Wind or animals carry the pieces away—maybe to another tree.\n Stayin’ alive\nSpanish moss lives on rain and fog, sunlight, and dust and dirt in the air. Its long tendrils are covered with tiny gray scales that trap and store water. After rain or dense fog, the plant looks greener. As it uses the water, it begins to look gray.\n Horsehair\nYou might see Spanish moss in a floral arrangement, garden art, or in arts and crafts. People once used it to stuff life vests, auto seats, and mattresses. First, they soaked it in water for weeks, until the outer layer rots away. The wiry fiber that's left is sometimes called \"horsehair.\" In the past, Spanish moss has also been used for packing material and for insulation.\n Neighborhood\nSome bats, frogs, and spiders make their homes in clumps of Spanish moss. Some birds line their nests with it.\n No moss here\nSpanish moss isn’t really a type of moss. (Mosses grow from spores, not seeds.) Spanish moss is a type of bromeliad. Bromeliads grow from seeds.

Transcriptomics and metabolomics techniques were used to analyze the response of the plant to Rn exposure. Spanish moss absorbed indoor CO2 at night using the type of photosynthesis termed crassulacean acid metabolism. The CO2 absorption efficiency of the plant was mainly affected by the light duration and diurnal temperature differences. The highest purification efficiency was 48.25%, and the scales on the Spanish moss leaf surface were the key sites for Rn adsorption.", "date": "NA"}, {"doc_id": "d5", "title": "Tillandsia usneoides Spanish Moss | Tropical Biodiversity", "url": "https://blogs.reading.ac.uk/tropical-biodiversity/2013/11/tillandsia-usneoides-spanish-moss/", "snippet": "Tillandsia usneoides Spanish Moss\nLacking ideas this Movember? Why not take inspiration from Spanish Moss and the great Spanish explorer Hernando De Soto, from whom the plant was thought to originate. Well at least as the legend goes…\nApparently Hernando De Soto pursued an Indian maiden through the forest and up a live oak tree. During the chase his gray beard became entangled in the tree, giving the maiden an opportunity to escape. De Soto freed himself, but several wisps of his beard were left behind. These remnants became Spanish Moss [1].\n The name Spanish Moss is quite misleading. Firstly, this plant isn’t even Spanish. The dangling beard-like festoons are found across much of the Americas adorning bald cypress (Taxodium distichum) and southern live oak trees (Quercus virginiana) or even telephone wires and fences. Spanish Moss isn’t a moss either. It belongs to Bromeliaceae a family of frequently epiphytic, rosette plants with spirally arranged leaves. It is likely to have been earned its rather confusing name because of its moss-like appearance and abundance throughout much of the former Spanish colonies of the New World [1].\n The more reliable binomial for Spanish Moss is Tillandsia usneoides (L.)L. The genus Tillandsia was named after after a Swedish physician and botanist Elias Tillandz, while the the specific epithet usneoides means ‘resembles usnea’, a genus of lichens also known as the beard lichens[5].\n Amazing adaptations!\n T. usneoides is arguably the most specialised member of Bromeliaceae. Itis a slender epiphytic perennial which has shed the requirement for roots, relying upon its corkscrew-like stems and acicular (needle like) leaves to tangle around themselves and other objects for support. It hangs in festoons around 8m long and has been reported to grow up to 30m long as a result of numerous shorter individual plants overlapping each other", "date": "NA"}]}

Patients should review their insurance policy and consult with their provider to understand the specific costs they will be responsible for.\n In addition to hospital fees, there are also surgeon fees to consider. Surgeon fees can vary depending on the complexity of the procedure and the surgeon's experience. It is crucial for patients to discuss these fees with their surgeon and understand what is included in the cost.\n Medication and Follow-up Care Costs\nAfter heart valve replacement surgery, patients may require medications to prevent infection, reduce the risk of blood clots, and manage other post-surgical complications. The cost of these medications can vary depending on factors such as insurance coverage and the specific medications prescribed.\n Some medications may need to be taken for a short period, while others may be required for a longer duration. It is important for patients to discuss the potential costs of these medications with their healthcare provider and explore options for financial assistance if needed.\n In addition to medications, regular follow-up care appointments with cardiologists and surgeons are necessary to monitor recovery and ensure optimal heart function. These appointments may involve additional costs, including diagnostic tests and imaging studies. The frequency and duration of follow-up care will depend on the individual patient's needs and the recommendations of their healthcare team.\n It is essential for patients to factor in these ongoing costs when planning for heart valve replacement surgery.

The aortic and mitral valves are the ones that surgeons most commonly replace. Most valve replacement surgeries are successful.\n When a person needs a heart valve replacement, doctors may use one of the following types of valves for the procedure:\nmechanical valves\nallografts, which are made from tissues harvested from a donor’s heart\npig valves\ncow valves\nSurgery\nA doctor may also recommend the Ross Procedure for a damaged aortic valve. This procedure involves swapping the person’s damaged aortic valve with their pulmonary valve and replacing the pulmonary valve with a donor valve.\n Replacing a heart valve often involves open-heart surgery.\n However, another option is transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), a less invasive procedure. Newer surgical techniques are emerging, such as robot-assisted procedures, which are also less invasive.\n Preparation for a valve replacement depends on the type of procedure a person is having.\n Prior to open-heart surgery, people will typically meet with the medical team performing the procedure to discuss the steps involved and any possible risks and complications.\n People will likely have to stay in the hospital the night before surgery to have blood work and other testing done. They must not eat after midnight before the surgery.\n Before the surgery, a hospital employee will shave the surgical area and direct the person to put on a hospital gown. They may administer a sedative to help the person relax. They will then move the person to the operating area, where the person will receive general anesthesia.\n Open-heart valve replacement\nThis type of replacement procedure involves opening up the chest to replace a damaged valve. To replace a valve, the medical team will have to stop the heart for 1 hour and use a heart-lung machine to continue circulating blood in the person’s body.\n Once the surgeons close the incision, the person will go to the intensive care unit (ICU).", "date": "Aug 31, 2022"}, {"doc_id": "d3", "title": "Costs of Heart Valve Surgery", "url": "https://www.heart-valve-surgery.com/costs-fees-estimates-money-insurance.php", "snippet": "Costs of Heart Valve Surgery\nMy number one priority for heart valve surgery focused on finding the right surgeon. I remember thinking, “Money is no object for this procedure. I don’t care what it costs. I want to find the best surgeon. I want the best care. I will go anywhere to have this done. I’ll worry about the fees afterward.”\n A long time ago, a friend once said to me, “When you die, the money in your bank account is irrelevant.” That might be cliche, but I believe it. That is why I was so adamant about finding the top cardiac surgeon for my heart valve replacement.\n Still, one of the most curious questions I had about heart valve surgery was, “How much is valve surgery going to cost me?”\nUnfortunately, no one I spoke with seemed to have a reliable answer to that question. My uncle told me, “A procedure like that will probably cost over $100,000.” Another buddy said, “My cousin had some valve work done... I hear it cost him $200,000.”\n I then went to the Internet and searched the world wide web for an answer. I never really found anything that detailed how much a heart valve surgery actually cost the patient.\n Eventually though, I found three references to heart valve surgery costs from Columbia University, The National Library of Medicine and East Carolina University. Here is what the references said:\nColumbia University. Between 1992 and 1997, length of hospital stay decreased from 13.4 to 8.0 days and cost decreased from $37,047 to $21,856. Similarly, between 1992 and 1997 for mitral valve repair, length of stay decreased from 15.6 to 8.1 days and cost decreased from $45,072 to $21,747. The net result over the time period from 1988 to 1997 was an average decline in the cost of operation of $785 a year, adjusted for other factors.\n National Library of Medicine.", "date": "Sep 17, 2020"}, {"doc_id": "d4", "title": "Relative Costs of Surgical and Transcatheter Aortic Valve ...", "url": "https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCINTERVENTIONS.119.008681", "snippet": "The average aggregate 6-month inpatient costs were $59 743 for SAVR, $64 395 for TAVR, and $23 460 for MT.", "date": "May 14, 2020"}, {"doc_id": "d5", "title": "Cost Analysis of Isolated Mitral Valve Surgery in the United States", "url": "https://www.annalsthoracicsurgery.org/article/S0003-4975(12)01308-2/fulltext", "snippet": "The mean and median typical cost for mitral valve repair was $30,720 and $28,717, respectively.

That’s a lot of money!” On the other hand, you might think, “That’s it! To keep me alive for another 10, 20 or 30 years… That’s nothing!” (Personally, the latter thought rushed through my brain as I digested these numbers.)\n Regardless of how you view the cost of heart valve replacement devices, we should probably remember that mechanical and bioprosthetic devices fall into the life sciences product category. The leading valve manufacturers — Edwards, Medtronic, ATS, St. Jude — have to extend millions, or even billions, of dollars on research and development (R&D) before they make one penny on a product sale. That said, pricing usually starts high as R&D costs are recouped. Then, over time, pricing decreases – just like the computer in front of you.

Today I’m sharing my guide to the best things to see and do (and eat!) in The Loop, West Loop, and River North – or the areas most would consider downtown. But before we jump into the guide, here are five fun facts to get you acquainted with the city quickly:\nFive Things You May Not Know About Chicago\nThe famed American roadway Route 66 begins in Chicago (unless you’re starting on the other end, in L.A.!) – you can find the route marker near the main entrance to the Art Institute of Chicago.\n The Chicago River is the only river in the world that has been reversed to run backward. Instead of running toward Lake Michigan, it now runs away from it.\n The Centennial Wheel at Navy Pier is now an iconic part of the Chicago skyline, but its importance to the city runs deeper than just sheer thrills. When Chicago hosted the World’s Fair in 1893, the Ferris wheel was the centerpiece of the exhibition – and the very first one.\n Commercial rent for properties along The Magnificent Mile (a 13-block portion of Michigan Avenue with hundreds of luxury retailers) is currently the third-highest in the nation – after Fifth Avenue in NYC and Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills.\n Now, let’s go visit!\n THINGS TO DO IN CHICAGO\nArts, culture, sports - Chicago has it all.

Solar eclipses occur when the Moon comes between the Sun and Earth. Such eclipses are either total, when the Moon completely blocks the Sun; annular, when the Moon is far from Earth and so covers the central part of the Sun, allowing the narrow ring of the Sun’s edge to shine around the Moon; or partial, when the Moon covers only some of the Sun. Lunar eclipses can be total, when the Moon passes through Earth’s shadow; partial, when the Moon goes through only some of Earth’s shadow; or penumbral, when the Moon goes through only the outermost parts of Earth’s shadow and thus dims only slightly.\n The table below lists all the eclipses that will occur in 2024, 2025, and 2026 and where on Earth they will occur.

Due to Earth's curvature, Earth may move through the Antumbral shadow (Annular eclipse) and Umbral shadow (Total eclipse) along different points of the eclipse path.\n DO NOT observe a solar eclipse with the naked eye. Serious eye damage can result. Use approved solar filters or cut a pin hole in a shoe box and watch the Sun's light cast through the pin hole onto a smooth surface such as cardboard. The only portion of a solar eclipse which is safe to view without filters is the brief time during totality. Otherwise all partial solar eclipses need approved filters. For approved filters, look for a certification of International Standard ISO 12312-2. The next solar eclipse which will be visible in the United States will occur on April 8, 2024.\nDATES OF UPCOMING TOTAL AND ANNULAR SOLAR ECLIPSES AND LOCATIONS OF BEST VIEWING\nA Lunar eclipse occurs when the Sun casts Earth's shadow onto the Moon. For this to happen, the Earth must be physically between the Sun and Moon with all three bodies lying on the same plane of orbit. A lunar eclipse can only occur during a Full Moon and when the Moon passes through all or a portion of Earth's shadow.\n The outer portion of the shadow cast from Earth is known as the penumbral shadow, which is an area where Earth obstructs only a part of the Sun's light from reaching the Moon. The umbral shadow is the \"inner\" shadow, which is the area where Earth blocks all direct sunlight from reaching the Moon. A penumbral lunar eclipse is subtle and very difficult to observe. A partial lunar eclipse is when a portion of the Moon passes through the Earth's umbral shadow.

Because the G3P exported from the chloroplast has three carbon atoms, it takes three “turns” of the Calvin cycle to fix enough net carbon to export one G3P. But each turn makes two G3Ps, thus three turns make six G3Ps. One is exported while the remaining five G3P molecules remain in the cycle and are used to regenerate RuBP, which enables the system to prepare for more CO2 to be fixed. Three more molecules of ATP are used in these regeneration reactions.\n Key Points\nThe Calvin cycle refers to the light-independent reactions in photosynthesis that take place in three key steps.\n Although the Calvin Cycle is not directly dependent on light, it is indirectly dependent on light since the necessary energy carriers (ATP and NADPH) are products of light-dependent reactions.\n In fixation, the first stage of the Calvin cycle, light-independent reactions are initiated; CO2 is fixed from an inorganic to an organic molecule.\n In the second stage, ATP and NADPH are used to reduce 3-PGA into G3P; then ATP and NADPH are converted to ADP and NADP+, respectively.\n In the last stage of the Calvin Cycle, RuBP is regenerated, which enables the system to prepare for more CO2 to be fixed.", "date": "2024-11-23 00:00:00"}, {"doc_id": "d8", "title": "C4 carbon fixation - Wikipedia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C4_carbon_fixation", "snippet": "C4 fixation is an addition to the ancestral and more common C3 carbon fixation. The main carboxylating enzyme in C3 photosynthesis is called RuBisCO, which catalyses two distinct reactions using either CO2 (carboxylation) or oxygen (oxygenation) as a substrate. RuBisCO oxygenation gives rise to phosphoglycolate, which is toxic and requires the expenditure of energy to recycle through photorespiration. C4 photosynthesis reduces photorespiration by concentrating CO2 around RuBisCO.\n To enable RuBisCO to work in a cellular environment where there is a lot of carbon dioxide and very little oxygen, C4 leaves generally contain two partially isolated compartments called mesophyll cells and bundle-sheath cells. CO2 is initially fixed in the mesophyll cells in a reaction catalysed by the enzyme PEP carboxylase in which the three-carbon phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) reacts with CO2 to form the four-carbon oxaloacetic acid (OAA). OAA can then be reduced to malate or transaminated to aspartate. These intermediates diffuse to the bundle sheath cells, where they are decarboxylated, creating a CO2-rich environment around RuBisCO and thereby suppressing photorespiration. The resulting pyruvate (PYR), together with about half of the phosphoglycerate (PGA) produced by RuBisCO, diffuses back to the mesophyll. PGA is then chemically reduced and diffuses back to the bundle sheath to complete the reductive pentose phosphate cycle (RPP). This exchange of metabolites is essential for C4 photosynthesis to work.\n Additional biochemical steps require more energy in the form of ATP to regenerate PEP, but concentrating CO2 allows high rates of photosynthesis at higher temperatures.

This pathway was called the Calvin cycle or photosynthetic carbon reduction (PCR) cycle and began with the incorporation of carbon dioxide (CO2) into the 5-carbon sugar ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP) to form a six-carbon intermediate which immediately splits to form two C3 molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate. In the latter half of the next decade Marshall Hatch and Roger Slack with, PhD students Hilary Johnson and John Andrews, working at the Brisbane laboratory of the Colonial Sugar Refining Co Ltd., provided evidence for the mechanism, enzymology and regulation of an alternative photosynthetic process operating in leaves of sugarcane. In this process, the first products of CO2 fixation are the C4 dicarboxylic acids, malate, aspartate and oxaloacetate, not the C3 molecule 3-phosphoglycerate. They named the process the C4 dicarboxylic pathway of photosynthesis, abbreviated later to the C4 pathway or C4 photosynthesis. Several other grass species and some species from other families were shown to have a similar mechanism. This alternative process, the NADP-malic enzyme-type, is one of three types of C4 photosynthesis subsequently identified in later years.\n With the closure of the CSR Brisbane laboratory in 1970, Marshall Hatch took up a position with the CSIRO Division of Plant Industry where he continued studies on this process until his retirement in 1997. Major contributions during that time included aspects of the resolution of the mechanism of two alternative biochemical options for C4 photosynthesis, details of the regulation of these processes and their role as CO2 concentrating mechanisms, identification of new enzymes, details of the regulation of key enzymes and their intracellular location and studies on the fluxes of metabolites between cells. He and colleagues finally identified all but one of the ten major enzymes involved in C4 photosynthesis.", "date": "2016-03-23 00:00:00"}]}

Nowadays, only symptomatic treatments exist for this disease, all trying to counterbalance the neurotransmitter disturbance: 3 cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine. To block the progression of the disease, therapeutic agents are supposed to interfere with the pathogenic steps responsible for the clinical symptoms, classically including the deposition of extracellular amyloid β plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangle formation. Other underlying mechanisms are targeted by neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, growth factor promotive, metabolic efficacious agents and stem cell therapies. Recent therapies have integrated multiple new features such as novel biomarkers, new neuropsychological outcomes, enrollment of earlier populations in the course of the disease, and innovative trial designs. In the near future different specific agents for every patient might be used in a “precision medicine” context, where aberrant biomarkers accompanied with a particular pattern of neuropsychological and neuroimaging findings could determine a specific treatment regimen within a customized therapeutic framework. In this review, we discuss potential disease-modifying therapies that are currently being studied and potential individualized therapeutic frameworks that can be proved beneficial for patients with AD.\nIntroduction\nAlzheimer disease (AD) is one of the greatest medical care challenges of our century and is the main cause of dementia.", "date": "2020-02-29"}, {"doc_id": "d8", "title": "Medications for Memory, Cognition & Dementia-Related Behaviors", "url": "https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/treatments/medications-for-memory", "snippet": "Although current medications cannot cure Alzheimer's, two U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatments address the underlying biology.

The site was surrounded by water on three sides (it was not fully an island yet) and was far inland; both meant it was easily defensible against possible Spanish attacks. The water was also deep enough that the English could tie their ships at the shoreline - good parking! The site was also not inhabited by the Native population.\n Once the spot was chosen the instructions sent by the Virginia Company, with the list of the council members (chosen by officials in England), was read. The names were kept in a sealed box on the ship (each ship had a sealed copy). The first President of the new Virginia colony was to be Edward Maria Winfield. The other six council members were: Bartholomew Gosnold, Christopher Newport, John Martin, John Ratcliffe, George Kendall, and John Smith.\n By June 15, the fort was completed. It was triangle shaped with a bulwark at each corner, holding four or five pieces of artillery. The settlers were now protected against any attacks that might occur from the local Powhatan Indians, whose hunting land they were living on. Relations had already been mixed between the newcomers and the Powhatan Indians. On June 22, Captain Newport left for England to get more supplies for the new settlement.\n Not long after Captain Newport left, the settlers began to succumb to a variety of diseases.

You never heard of a horse going broke betting on people.” –Will Rogers\nWe know from old movies that once upon a time, people traveled by horse. When did people switch from horses to cars? How were they persuaded to make that switch?\n It all happened in a single decade, beginning in 1907. That’s when the car began to come into its own, replacing the horse and the bicycle as a means for transporting people and goods, across the United States. At that time, there were just 140,300 registered cars and only 2,900 trucks in America.\n They’d Stopped Riding Horses\nPeople still traveled by railroad for long distances, and by foot or horse-drawn carriage for shorter distances. Goods were transported in much the same way. But by this time in history, just about no one rode horses. Lots of people, however, rode bicycles for fun and for carrying things from place to place.\n By 1917, just ten years later, the number of registered cars had increased 33 fold, to nearly 5 million, with a 134-fold increase in other vehicles (commercial, agricultural, and military) so that they now numbered close to 400,000. It had become downright dangerous for horses to be out on the road. Cars now ruled.

Transmissions and throttle controls were widely adopted, allowing a variety of cruising speeds.

Horses were used for work, transport, war and many other purposes. Yet, these days most of those tasks are now carried out by cars or other motorised vehicles.\n The history of Horses and Humans\nHumans domesticated the horse about 6,000 years ago. This led to us being able to use the power and durability of these animals to allow society to progress. People could now travel longer distances and to carry out tasks such as farming more easily.\n From their beginning in the Eurasian steppes, horses spread out over the planet. The European explorers and settlers took them to lands like America, where horses quickly adapted and became a huge part of life for natives and settlers alike.\n The switch to Motorised Vehicles\nThe Industrial Revolution showed us that machines were the future. Yet, horses remained in place as one of our most valuable methods of transportation and brute strength. There are famous pictures of horses being used in battles as late as World War One, where up to eight million of them lost their lives. But by then the end of their use as the most common transport method was near.\n The switch to cars happened very quickly, with the US leading the way. In a single decade, the American roads went from having just over 140,000 cars (in 1907) to close to five million in 1917. The number of commercial and agricultural vehicles increased at an even greater rate in this period.\n Another set of figures from the US shows that there were 22 million horses in 1925 but only 18 million five years later, followed by further declines. On the other hand, cars rose from 20 million to over 26 million in the same period. By now, horses were far less commonly used as a transport method in North America.\n This story tells us how Brooklyn replaced its horse-drawn fire engine with a motorized version in 1922. It was a story that was repeated across the planet, as new technology came into reach for more and more people who had previously relied on equine power.", "date": "2021-04-27 00:00:00"}, {"doc_id": "d8", "title": "Early Cars: Fact Sheet for Children - Smithsonian Institution", "url": "https://www.si.edu/spotlight/early-cars", "snippet": "This process made steam that expanded and pushed pistons, which turned a crankshaft. An electric car had a battery that powered a small electric motor, which turned a drive shaft. A gasoline car ignited fuel that caused a small explosion inside each cylinder. This explosion pushed the piston and turned a crankshaft connected to the wheels by a chain or drive shaft.\n Who drove the first cars?\n In 1900 wealthy people bought cars for pleasure, comfort, and status. Many doctors bought small, affordable cars because they were more dependable than horses and easier to keep ready. Rural Americans liked cars because they could cover long distances without depending on trains. They carried produce to market, went to stores and movies in town, and even used their cars to plow fields. Families in towns and cities liked cars because they were handy for errands, going to the train station, visiting relatives, going to church, and going on drives in the country. A family’s house with a car in the driveway has been a common sight since about 1910. Young people liked cars because they could go to movies, restaurants, and other fun places instead of staying at home with their parents.\n Why do so many people use cars?\n Cars are fast, comfortable, nice looking, and fun to drive. They can go almost anywhere, and they are always ready for use. In many ways, driving is easier than walking, biking, or riding in a train, bus, or airplane. But owning a car is a big responsibility. It takes a lot of money to buy one and keep it running, and drivers must be trained, licensed, and always alert to avoid mistakes and accidents. It takes a lot of space to park cars, and too many cars cause congestion on roads and in parking lots. Some car owners have returned to walking, biking, or riding a train or bus when it’s more practical or convenient. For most Americans, cars are a favorite way to travel, but there will always be a need for other types of transportation.\n What was different about the Ford Model T?", "date": "2018-01-01"}, {"doc_id": "d9", "title": "Horses Go Out of Business: Technology That Changed Chicago", "url": "https://www.chipublib.org/blogs/post/technology-that-changed-chicago-horses-go-out-of-business/", "snippet": "In 1950 only 329 horse-drawn vehicles were left.

The only actual count of horses that I have been able to find comes from the Bureau of Streets as reported in the Annual Report of the Department of Public Works. In 1907, they counted 77,147 horses.\n An immense volume of manure had to be swept up and carted off. Especially after 1900, the flies and smell began to be considered problems.

However, they can be administered by a variety of health care providers.\n The most effective tests for detecting cancer\nAlthough blood tests are useful, other tests are almost always necessary for diagnosing cancer. These include:\nMany health care providers encourage women to get a baseline mammogram at age 40 and every year thereafter. Women who have a family history of breast cancer should discuss their risk factors with their health care providers and consider screenings at an earlier age.\n Similarly for lung cancer, the most common cancer in the world, any individual with a significant smoking history should get a CT scan between 50 and 80 years old. During a CT scan, you lie on a table and an X-ray machine uses a low dose of radiation to make detailed images of your lungs.\n The importance of early cancer detection\n Regardless of your type of cancer, early detection is key to ensuring optimal outcomes.\n \"Early detection of cancer is important because cancer is typically divided into various stages depending on what part of the body it's involving,\" says Nebraska Medicine cancer doctor, Apar Kishor Ganti, MD, MS.", "date": "NA"}, {"doc_id": "d2", "title": "Do Routine Blood Tests Detect Cancer? | Mira", "url": "https://www.talktomira.com/post/do-routine-blood-tests-detect-cancer", "snippet": "Explore Categories\nExplore Tags\nDo Routine Blood Tests Detect Cancer?\nRoutine blood work can detect early signs of cancers, particularly blood cancers such as leukemia and lymphoma. Routine blood tests are recommended for healthy individuals. They can also give insight into organ function, diet, metabolism, and even detect signs of cancer. Four types of blood tests detect cancer, as explained in this article.\n Purpose of Routine Blood Work\nRoutine blood work refers to blood tests ordered by your doctor as part of your yearly physical. They are used to screen for a range of health conditions, helping you make informed diet, lifestyle, and fitness choices. Routine blood work can also detect illness before symptoms arise. A routine complete blood count test (CBC) is also commonly referred to as routine blood work.\n Factors That Influence Recommended Blood Tests\nNot everyone is recommended the same blood tests. Your family history, age, sex, personal risk factors, and current health status influence the frequency and type of blood tests a doctor might recommend.

Knowing if the tumor has PD-L1 will help your doctor decide if certain types of immunotherapy are more or less likely to be helpful (see Types of Treatment).\n Currently, there are different biomarker tests that can be done to determine if you have any genetic changes. Sometimes, there may not be enough tissue to test for all of the mutations. Your health care team may decide to test for the most likely changes or they may need to do another biopsy to get enough tissue. Learn more about biomarker testing in lung cancer.\n Liquid biopsy. A type of blood test called a \"liquid biopsy\" is being used more and more to help diagnose specific genetic changes in people with NSCLC, but it cannot be used to diagnose the cancer itself. This test looks for a type of DNA called \"circulating tumor DNA.\" Like healthy cells, cancer cells die and are replaced. When these dead cells break down, they are released into the bloodstream. A liquid biopsy can detect the small pieces of DNA in the bloodstream from these cells.\n Liquid biopsies are less invasive than other types of biopsies and have less risks. Liquid biopsies can be done as a part of your initial diagnosis and they can be done multiple times throughout treatment. Learn more about liquid biopsy and what to expect.\n After diagnostic tests are done, your doctor will review all of the results with you. If the diagnosis is cancer, these results also help the doctor describe the cancer. This is called staging.\n Coping with an NSCLC diagnosis\nFor most patients, a diagnosis of NSCLC is extremely stressful. Some people who are diagnosed with NSCLC develop anxiety and, less commonly, depression. You and your families should not be afraid to talk with the health care team about how you feel.

The Galleri multi-cancer early detection test can detect cancer signals across more than 50 types of cancer, as defined by the American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging Manual, through a routine blood draw. When a cancer signal is detected, the Galleri test predicts the cancer signal origin, or where the cancer is located in the body, with high accuracy to help guide the next steps to diagnosis. The Galleri test requires a prescription from a licensed health care provider and should be used in addition to recommended cancer screenings such as mammography, colonoscopy, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test, or cervical cancer screening. It is intended for use in people with an elevated risk of cancer, such as those aged 50 or older. For more information about Galleri, visit galleri.com.\n Important Galleri Safety Information The Galleri test is recommended for use in adults with an elevated risk for cancer, such as those aged 50 or older. The Galleri test may not detect a cancer signal across all cancers and should be used in addition to routine cancer screening tests recommended by a health care provider. Galleri is intended to detect cancer signals and predict where in the body the cancer signal is located. Use of Galleri is not recommended in individuals who are pregnant, 21 years old or younger, or undergoing active cancer treatment.\n Results should be interpreted by a health care provider in the context of medical history, clinical signs and symptoms. A test result of “Cancer Signal Not Detected” does not rule out cancer. A test result of “Cancer Signal Detected” requires confirmatory diagnostic evaluation by medically established procedures (e.g. imaging) to confirm cancer.\n If cancer is not confirmed with further testing, it could mean that cancer is not present or testing was insufficient to detect cancer, including due to the cancer being located in a different part of the body.

After all, future generations cannot quench the violent potential of humanity without intentional self-education.\n Reconquista - 781 Years\nThe Capitulation of Granada, 1492.\n Spanning an incredible 781 years, the Reconquista was a long and arduous war fought by Spanish and Portuguese forces against the Muslim rulers of the Iberian Peninsula. The conflict began around 711 CE when an Islamic-Berber army crossed the Straight of Gibraltar. These invaders entered Spain and Portugal, and by 718 CE, the Moors controlled much of Iberia. Christian Kingdoms fell to the prowess of the Cordoban Caliphate until the caliph disintegrated in the 11th century. After that point, Christian kingdoms slowly resurged and grew to dominate the peninsula. Though there were a series of defeats and victories on both sides throughout these centuries, eventually, in 1492 CE, Granada in present-day southern Andalusia finally fell to Ferdinand II and Isabella I.

The longest war in U.S. history has come at the financial cost of close to $1 trillion. It has killed more than 2,000 American soldiers and, according to some estimates, hundreds of thousands of Afghans.\n The United States invaded Afghanistan on October 7, 2001. President George W. Bush authorized the war in response to 9/11—Taliban-ruled Afghanistan was providing refuge for al Qaeda, the terrorist organization that had orchestrated the attacks. Al Qaeda’s leader, Osama bin Laden, evaded the U.S. military for a decade, but the Taliban regime fell within weeks. U.S. and allied forces stayed in Afghanistan to support a new government in Kabul. But the Taliban soon regrouped. For years, the fighting ebbed and surged as Washington tossed around versions of the same questions: With more time and resources, could the U.S. military finally rout the Taliban and the terrorists they had harbored? Was staying the course a better option than risking the collapse of the fledgling Afghan state? Or was it necessary to find a way out, whether by negotiation or unilateral withdrawal?\n Over the past two decades, senior officials—including U.S. ambassadors, commanders of U.S. and NATO military forces, and the current president of Afghanistan—as well as leading scholars and journalists have assessed the progress of the war and the prospects of its resolution in the pages of Foreign Affairs.

The war is one of the longest in American history, roughly double the time the nation spent in both of the world wars combined. But in the context of world history, there are wars that dwarf the conflict. (Also check out: The 35 billion-dollar weapons in the U.S. Military budget.)\n Some wars are quick, especially for countries who spend a lot on their military. But this is not always the case. Before technology made it possible to kill many enemies from anywhere, opposing sides could retreat, take refuge in a fortified castle, and wait to go back out and fight. This allowed some wars in the past to drag out decades and even centuries.\n 24/7 Wall St. has compiled a list of the longest wars in history by reviewing data and articles from various sources. In order to appear on this list, a conflict had to meet the definition of war as an open and usually declared armed conflict between political entities such as sovereign states or competing factions within the same state, such as a civil war. The conflict had to be sustained over a period of time and intended to resolve political or territorial disputes.\n In the early 18th century, Sweden was the dominant power in the Baltic region. Three neighboring kingdoms — Russia, Denmark-Norway, and Saxony-Poland — formed a coalition to attack Sweden. They attacked after King Charles XI died and his 14-year-old son Charles XII was crowned. As the war continued, England and Prussia also joined the Russian coalition, sensing an opportunity to gain more land and resources. Finally, after more than two decades of fighting, Sweden surrendered and forfeited much of its territory and wealth to its opponents. This event helped turn Russia into the world power it is today and damaged Sweden’s influence on the world stage.\n The Peloponnesian War was a conflict between Greek city states — one side led by Athens and the other by Sparta.

All penguins maintain a body temperature between 100 and 102 degrees Fahrenheit (around 38°C) but they live in temperatures that range from 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32°C) along the coast of Patagonia to negative 76 degrees Fahrenheit (-60°C) on the sea ice of Antarctica. Feathers account for nearly 85 percent of a bird’s insulation, and when the weather is warm that insulation can make temperatures a bit toasty. The banded penguins, such as the Humboldt and African penguins, have featherless patches on their faces and feet where they divert blood to cool when overheated. In contrast, the Adélie penguin, one of two Antarctic species, has complete feather coverage up to the base of its beak.\n Although feathers can be fluffed up or flattened down, penguins also use other methods to keep their temperatures at the right level. When an Adélie penguin overheats it diverts blood to its thin wings, causing the white undersides to turn a faint pink color.

By taking action now, we can help these remarkable creatures continue to thrive in their icy environments for generations to come.\n Conclusion\nIn conclusion, penguins are perfectly adapted to live in cold places due to their unique physical characteristics and behavioral adaptations. Their thick layer of blubber, waterproof feathers, and counter-current heat exchange system help them stay warm in freezing temperatures. Their streamlined bodies and webbed feet enable them to swim efficiently in icy waters, while their ability to dive deep allows them to find food in the cold ocean. Penguins also gather in large colonies, which provides them with additional warmth and protection. Despite the harsh conditions, penguins have found a way to thrive in these cold environments, making them truly remarkable creatures. So, the next time you see a penguin waddling on the ice, remember that they are perfectly suited to their chilly homes.\n Frequently Asked Questions\nQ1: Why do penguins live in the cold?\nPenguins are adapted to live in cold climates like the Antarctic habitat. Their bodies have evolved over time to withstand freezing temperatures. They have a layer of fat under their skin for thermal insulation and their feathers provide an additional layer of warmth.\n Q2: Do all penguins live in cold climates?\n No, not all penguins live in cold climates. While many species are found in Antarctica and other icy habitats, some species like the Galapagos penguin live in warmer climates near the equator.\n Q3: How do penguins survive in cold weather?\nPenguins have several survival strategies for cold weather. They have a high body fat percentage that provides thermal insulation. Their feathers are waterproof and trap a layer of air for additional insulation. Penguins also huddle together in large groups to share body heat.\n Q4: What penguins live in cold climates?", "date": "NA"}, {"doc_id": "d3", "title": "Can Penguins Live in Warm Weather? - Frosty Arctic", "url": "https://frostyarctic.com/can-penguins-live-in-warm-weather/", "snippet": "Can Penguins Live in Warm Weather?\n The answer is yes. Penguins can live in warm regions as well! Almost 14 species of penguins are currently living in areas with warm climates. Only four species of penguins live in cold regions. Even the African penguin, the jackass penguin, can survive in hot weather.\n If you’ve also known that penguins live in cold regions only, now you know that’s not the truth. What if there are more such facts that you don’t know of? Well, let’s see then!\n About Penguins’ Life in Warm Weather\nSince penguins do not only live in cold regions and actually can also survive in warm regions, let’s learn more about their lives in areas where the weather is warm. There are about 14 different species of penguins that live in warm areas.\n Penguins’ lives seem to be pretty fun in warm areas. Penguins survive in warm regions by stretching their flippers (wings) out to the side and leaning over to shade their feet from the sun. They protect their eggs from the heat of the sun by laying them in cracks and creases of rocks.\n Warm-weather penguins have the same height as penguins in Antarctica. However, they have some distinct features that allow them to survive in warm temperatures. If their body temperatures become higher than normal, they also pant to cool down again.\n What Temperatures do Penguins Live in?\nPenguins live in a variety of temperatures because many penguin species have different habitats. Some mostly only live in the southern hemisphere, in Antarctica, whereas some live in the northern hemisphere too.\n Penguins can survive temperatures from 32 degrees centigrade to 22 degrees Celsius in warmer areas such as Patagonia, Argentina. If the climate gets too hot for these penguins, they spread their wings and lean over their feet to lose some body temperature to remain cool.\n Why can’t most Penguins Survive the Heat?\nEven though some penguins live in warm areas, most penguins are still unable to survive the heat.", "date": "NA"}, {"doc_id": "d4", "title": "Letter from Stephanie: Antarctic Adaptations | AMNH", "url": "https://www.amnh.org/learn-teach/curriculum-collections/antarctica/organisms/antarctic-adaptations", "snippet": "The dark plumage of a penguin's dorsal surface (her back) absorbs heat from the Sun, which increases body temperature further.\n What about all that ice? On land, Emperor penguins rest their entire weight on their heels and tail, reducing contact of their feet with the icy surface. They can also tuck their flippers in close to their bodies and shiver to generate additional heat. And they have very powerful noses! Emperor penguins are able to recapture 80% of heat escaping in their breath through a complex heat exchange system in their nasal passages.\n Emperor penguins are so well-suited to cold, they can overheat on land; so they also need adaptations that allow them to cool down. The penguin's circulatory system can actually adjust to environmental conditions, either conserving or releasing body heat to keep body temperature constant. To conserve heat, blood flowing to the flippers and legs transfers its heat to blood returning to the heart, thus helping to keep heat in the body. To cool off, penguins can ruffle their feathers, breaking up the insulating air layer next to the skin and releasing heat. Penguins can also hold their flippers away from their bodies, exposing both surfaces of the flippers to air; this releases heat. (That's the same reason that a dog lets his tongue roll out on hot days!)\n Emperor penguins have also developed adaptations in their breeding patterns. Unlike other Antarctic birds, Emperors breed in the Antarctic fall/winter, around April, laying their eggs in May. This ensures that the chicks hatch in the late winter, when resources are becoming available, and that the chicks have more time to develop in mild conditions.\n The females don't stay home with the eggs, either! Male Emperors remain on the sea ice platform and incubate the eggs while the females return to the ocean to feed.

But, some species which are suitable for cold environments cannot persist in warm weathers.\n Conversely, if the penguin of the cold climate gets born in the warm weather, it could be probable that owing to the adaptation difficulties, it might not survive for the elongated period.\n It is not mandatory that penguins need icy and snowy regions for their survival.

They get their name from the Humboldt Current, which flows up from Antarctica along the coast of South America. So the warm Hawaiian weather is actually quite comfortable for them, and if they ever need to cool off they can always take a swim.\n The water in the penguin habitat is salt water – penguins are actually a type of seabird! Sea Life Park pumps about 12 million gallons of fresh sea water through our habitats every day. We do not put any kind of chemicals into that water, so algae grows naturally in our habitats. This algae called diatoms actually absorb harmful sunlight and produce atmospheric oxygen.\n Adaptations\nPenguins are birds however they cannot fly. They have many adaptations for swimming and survival in the water. Their wings are shaped like paddles, which enables them to swim up to speeds of 9 miles per hour. They can also dive about 1 to 2 meters deep, and hold their breath for about 1 minute. However, the deepest penguin dive was recorded at 1, 752 feet.\n Why Are Penguins Black & White?\nA penguins coloration is actually a type of camouflage called counter-shading. The back is black because looking down through the water the dark color blends in with the dark colors of the ocean, and the front is white because if a predator was looking up, the penguin would blend in with the light from the sun reflecting on the water.", "date": "NA"}]}

General Motors has said it aims to stop selling new gasoline-powered cars and light trucks by 2035 and will pivot to battery-powered models. This week, Volvo said it would move even faster and introduce an all-electric lineup by 2030.\n But as electric cars and trucks go mainstream, they have faced a persistent question: Are they really as green as advertised?\nWhile experts broadly agree that plug-in vehicles are a more climate-friendly option than traditional vehicles, they can still have their own environmental impacts, depending on how they’re charged up and manufactured. Here’s a guide to some of the biggest worries — and how they might be addressed.\n One way to compare the climate impacts of different vehicle models is with this interactive online tool by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who tried to incorporate all the relevant factors: the emissions involved in manufacturing the cars and in producing gasoline and diesel fuel, how much gasoline conventional cars burn, and where the electricity to charge electric vehicles comes from.\n If you assume electric vehicles are drawing their power from the average grid in the United States, which typically includes a mix of fossil fuel and renewable power plants, then they’re almost always much greener than conventional cars. Even though electric vehicles are more emissions-intensive to make because of their batteries, their electric motors are more efficient than traditional internal combustion engines that burn fossil fuels.\n An all-electric Chevrolet Bolt, for instance, can be expected to produce 189 grams of carbon dioxide for every mile driven over its lifetime, on average. By contrast, a new gasoline-fueled Toyota Camry is estimated to produce 385 grams of carbon dioxide per mile. A new Ford F-150 pickup truck, which is even less fuel-efficient, produces 636 grams of carbon dioxide per mile.\n But that’s just an average.", "date": "NA"}, {"doc_id": "d3", "title": "Don't get fooled: Electric vehicles really are better for the climate ...", "url": "https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2022/11/dont-get-fooled-electric-vehicles-really-are-better-for-the-climate/", "snippet": "Bottom line: Reichmuth’s team compared an average gas-powered sedan (32 miles per gallon) with an average-efficiency EV (300-mile-range battery) and found that the EV reduces total lifetime emissions by 52%.\n “You can also think of it as the manufacturing emissions being a deficit or debt that is sort of ‘paid back’ by emissions savings,” Reichmuth said.\n For the average driver — one who drives about 10,650 miles a year — “there’s a net climate benefit as long as that car’s on the road for two years,” Reichmuth said. “And most of these cars are being driven 10 to 15 years, so it really is a net benefit.”\nMore clean power and innovation are likely to cut pollution from electric vehicle manufacturing\nIn the future, adding more renewables to the power mix and continuing to make other technological advances are likely to help reduce the climate impacts of EV manufacturing.\n “Some of those manufacturing emissions will be helped as we both clean up the grid and clean up transportation,” he said.\n Reichmuth’s research looked at what would happen if car manufacturers switch to using renewable energy at their factories. “If you’re using 100% carbon-free electricity in battery manufacturing,” he said, “it would reduce battery emissions by 27%.”\n Some emissions result from transporting materials from the point of extraction to production facilities, so electrifying the industrial trucking sector would also help improve manufacturing’s climate footprint.\n Verdict: electric cars are already better for the climate than gas-fueled vehicles — but there’s room for improvement.\n ​The transportation sector accounts for about 27% of total U.S. climate-warming pollution, making it the largest contributor to the nation’s emissions.

As more drivers make the switch to electric vehicles, that means a cleaner, healthier future with less global warming emissions.\n In a new analysis, “Driving Cleaner: How Electric Cars and Pick-Ups Beat Gasoline on Lifetime Global Warming Emissions,” the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) shows that switching to electric cars or pickup trucks from comparable gasoline vehicles is one of the most effective ways we can reduce emissions and avoid the worst impacts of climate change. On average, electric vehicles produce less than half the global warming emissions that come from driving a similar gasoline vehicle. This advantage has grown with a cleaner electrical grid and more efficient EV technology. And that advantage holds over the whole lifetime of the vehicle, from manufacture to driving to disposal.\n Transportation is the largest source of global warming emissions in the U.S., and more than half of that pollution comes from passenger cars, trucks, and SUVs. Making the emissions cuts we need to fight climate change means electrifying the cars and trucks that we use to get around.\n “The electric vehicle market is poised to grow dramatically, with more options than ever, from small cars to pickup trucks,” said David Reichmuth, senior vehicles engineer in the Clean Transportation Program at UCS. “This is an exciting moment—and drivers can be confident that by making the switch, they’ll be helping to rein in climate change.”\n Today, the average electric vehicle is so clean that the global warming emissions are the equivalent of driving a car getting 91 miles to the gallon.\n For 90 percent of the country, driving an electric vehicle is cleaner than driving even the most efficient gasoline vehicle. That’s up from two-thirds of the country in 2015—a remarkable improvement in less than a decade, thanks mostly to an increasingly clean electric grid.\n Manufacturers are delivering electric versions of more vehicle models, and that’s especially important for pickup trucks, a growing part of the passenger vehicle market.", "date": "NA"}, {"doc_id": "d6", "title": "Why tech companies are wrong to think electric cars are a solution to ...", "url": "https://www.euronews.com/next/2022/09/19/why-tech-companies-are-wrong-to-think-electric-cars-are-a-solution-to-climate-change", "snippet": "Electric cars are not the solution\nTech companies offer to replace - little by little - vehicles equipped with internal combustion engines, which are considered too polluting, with electric vehicles which have a much lower carbon footprint.\n But lower doesn't mean zero either.\n It’s true that fully electric vehicles do not emit waste products but the batteries that supply energy to the vehicle are made of minerals like lithium and cobalt which have an impact on climate change.\n “In order to create an electric car, a lot of minerals need to be mined and much of that will continue to happen in the global south.

It may be achieved best by shifting from Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) cars to Electric Vehicles (EVs). However, the transition to a low carbon mode of transport will not be instantaneous and any policy or technological change implemented now will take years to have the desired effect. Within this paper we show how on-road emission factors of EVs and models of embedded CO2 in the vehicle production may be combined with statistics for vehicle uptake/replacement to forecast future transport emissions. We demonstrate that EVs, when compared to an efficient ICE, provide few benefits in terms of CO2 mitigation until 2030. However, between 2030 and 2050, predicted CO2 savings under the different EV uptake and decarbonisation scenarios begin to diverge with larger CO2 savings seen for the accelerated EV uptake. This work shows that simply focusing on on-road emissions is insufficient to model the future CO2 impact of transport. Instead a more complete production calculation must be combined with an EV uptake model. Using this extended model, our scenarios show how the lack of difference between a Business as Usual and accelerated EV uptake scenario can be explained by the time-lag in cause and effect between policy changes and the desired change in the vehicle fleet. Our work reveals that current UK policy is unlikely to achieve the desired reduction in transport-based CO2 by 2030. If embedded CO2 is included as part of the transport emissions sector, then all possible UK EV scenarios will miss the reduction target for 2050 unless this is combined with intense decarbonisation (80% of 1990 levels) of the UK electricity grid. This result highlights that whilst EVs offer an important contribution to decarbonisation in the transport sector it will be necessary to look at other transport mitigation strategies, such as modal shift to public transit, car sharing and demand management, to achieve both near-term and long-term mitigation targets.", "date": "NA"}, {"doc_id": "d9", "title": "Methanol: the Surprising Solution for Pollution, Global Warming and ...", "url": "https://www.advent.energy/2019/02/01/htpem-methanol-fuel-cell-electric-car/", "snippet": "Some companies are already producing hybrid buses that feature half the Li-ion battery, no air pollutants, twice the range, a methanol tank, and a range-extender (electrochemical fuel cell).\n The Opportunity and the Problem\nToday, China is leading the transition to electric vehicles accounting for 50% of new vehicles and expected to remain close to 40% in the foreseeable future (1).

However, most people will class an animal as capable of pain if they have a central nervous system and brain. Oysters have neither of these, which has led many to assume that they are not capable of such emotions. While it may be less likely they feel pain compared to animals like dogs, cats, fish, and insects, there is no scientific evidence that proves it.\n Oysters do have a basic nervous system and a small heart and internal organs.

Mouth-watering but verboten.\n Of course, from juicy tomatoes to corn on the cob, I savor summer’s vegetable bounty with everyone else. And there’s another summer staple I eat without guilt: oysters.\n What’s more, even vegans, whose diets forbid animals and animal products like cheese and honey (both of which I permit myself), should feel free to savor oysters “by the boatload.” That goes for mussels, too.\nTechnically, vegans who eat these simple shellfish are “ostrovegans.” Guzzling them isn’t culinary sacrilege, if your goal is to avoid inflicting suffering on animals — not just slaughter but also the fear and discomfort of industrial husbandry’s inhumane confinement. The belief that oysters and mussels can feel pain and discomfort is as rooted in science as the nostrum that you shouldn’t eat the former in months with an “r” in their names.\n Biology suggests that both bivalves are the functional equivalent of plants, without the capacity for pain. They lack what would be considered a central nervous system and brain. Nor can they move on their own. Evolutionists point out that motion and a nervous system are nature’s tools for sensing and moving away from painful stimuli.\n Of course, we can’t be 100 percent sure they don’t feel pain in some way we don’t understand.

It’s troubling to find numerous members in the vegan community supporting the exploitation of animal species based on articles unsupported by a single shred of evidence. More alarming is how these articles try to establish oysters, mussels, and even other animals in the vegan community as being akin to plants, rocks, and as one stated, “a disembodied finger.”\n Modern molecular and taxonomic advances have led scientists to base classification of living beings in very specific ways. I won’t further delve into the subject, but I will say that oysters and other animal species are not comparable to plants. The plant and animal kingdom are separate for good reason regardless of what supporters of bivalve eating in the vegan community will have you believe. One of the most important differences is that plants do not have a nervous system while bivalves do.\n The same bivalve eating individuals claim that mussels and oysters are not sentient because they do not have “brains,” and while it is true that mussels and oyster do not have a brain in the sense that you or I do, they do have ganglia. Ganglia, in simple terms, is basically their form of a brain — how they get their systems to function and respond when they need to. Yes, invertebrates have much simpler nervous systems than vertebrates, but they still have nervous systems. How developed their nervous system depends on the species. More importantly, their form of a nervous system allows them to respond to their living conditions and survive in them.\n “Most, if not all, invertebrates have the capacity to detect and respond to noxious or aversive stimuli.

This is a controversial topic among the vegan community and is not a viewpoint shared by most vegans.\n Keep in mind, also, there are two types of ostrovegans: those who only eat oysters and mussels, versus those who include clams and scallops, as well. Why the difference?\nOysters and mussels are “sessile,” meaning they do not move. Therefore, there is more of a logical reason to believe they do not feel pain. (What would be the evolutionary function of pain in an organism that can’t move away?)\n Clams and scallops are motile, meaning they move around.

As well as this, 95% of oysters in the world are farmed, however, the farming is sustainable and actually doesn’t negatively affect the environment. Oysters purify the water they’re in, taking in CO2 and nitrogen from the atmosphere, meaning they can actually impact the environment positively. As lots of people go vegan for environmental reasons above all, some make an exception for oysters due to its sustainable and environmentally-friendly farming practices.\n But are they really vegan?\n By definition, no, oysters are not vegan; they are still living organisms which means they can’t be considered a vegan food.

The news media hails them as âsuper smart,â and after meeting Chaser, astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson exclaimed, âWho would have thought that animals are capable of this much display of intellect?â So, what are these dogs doing with words?\nLetâs look at the types of words that dogs understand.\nObjects\nDogs can learn the names of many, many, many different objects. Julia Fischer, group leader at the German Primate Centerâs Cognitive Ethology Lab, heard that a Border Collie named Rico knew the names of 70 individual objects, and she wanted to know how Rico mapped specific human words to particular objects. âI contacted the owners, and they let us visit their home and start a study of Rico,â explains Fischer. This culminated in 2004 with an article in Science, reporting that Rico knew the names of over 200 different objects.\n Seven years later, Chaser, a Border Collie in South Carolina, took the gold medal when Alliston Reid and John Pilley of Wofford College reported that Chaser knew the distinct names of 1,022 objects â more than 800 cloth animals, 116 balls, 26 Frisbees, and 100 plastic items.

The canines were successfully trained when they could distinguish between the two objects by consistently fetching the one requested by the owner when presented with both.\n After the training, the scientists then examined the pooches by administering fMRI scans. During the procedure, the doggy’s owner stood directly in front of the dog at the opening of the machine, calling out the name of the toys at set intervals and then holding up the corresponding toys. They also said gibberish words to their dogs and showed them something they hadn’t seen before as a control.\n After analyzing the results, the researchers found that regions of the dogs’ brains responsible for auditory processing were more activated when hearing gibberish words. They believe their findings mean dogs can tell the difference between human words they’ve previously heard and words they haven’t.\n “We expected to see that dogs neurally discriminate between words that they know and words that they don’t,” Prichard said. “What’s surprising is that the result is opposite to that of research on humans — people typically show greater neural activation for known words than novel words.”\n The researchers said the dogs’ brains are more activated by the novel terms, “because they sense their owners want them to understand what they are saying, and they are trying to do so,” the team wrote.\n The researchers did note their findings do not mean spoken words are the most effective way for an owner to communicate with a dog.

They miss you the most when you leave, and are the most excited when you get back, so naturally, you’d want to speak to them. You may often catch yourself in the middle of asking them who wants dinner, not expecting a reply entirely, and then stop and think, “does my dog understand me?”.\n Seeing that they can neither speak back nor understand the vastness of human language, this common question can leave you feeling a little ridiculous- so we’re here to answer it. In short, yes, dogs can understand what we say, but to a certain extent. Allow us to break it down for you.\n When it comes to effective communication, there are 2 factors at play:\nLinguistic content – what is being said\nEmotional content – how it’s being said\nLinguistic content\nAs defined by a vocable, words are essentially just sounds if you take away their meaning, and while dogs may not be able to comprehend all of them, they certainly can set apart a few when they are used frequently.\n This is why it’s possible to train your dog to respond to commands like “sit” and “paw”- they hear the different words, and they know the appropriate action. Thus, in a certain way, they are able to understand its meaning.\n Similarly, you may notice that your dog tends to favour certain words; perhaps “dinner” or “walk” or “treat”. They have associated these frequently used words with the situations that follow, and are able to remember the different things that each one entails. Give it a try with your own dog and watch how they respond.\n In fact, research has shown that the vocabulary of a dog can hold up to 165 words on average, and is quite similar to that of a 2-3 year old in terms of what they can understand.\n This being said, your dog does not understand any particular human language, it is merely able to remember vocables and attach meaning to them.", "date": "NA"}, {"doc_id": "d7", "title": "Can animals understand human language? | HowStuffWorks", "url": "https://animals.howstuffworks.com/animal-facts/can-animals-understand-human-language.htm", "snippet": "Can animals understand human language?\n\"\"\nDo animals really understand what we're saying to them or are they royally duping us?\nMike Watson Images/Thinkstock\nHumans have a special relationship with house pets, and a full 62 percent claim that their pets understand the words that they speak [source: USA Today].

A similar study conducted on another border collie named Chaser went even further; not only could Chaser distinguish the names of at least 1,022 objects, he could also infer the names of new objects [source: Hecht]. For example, if asked to fetch Mr. Monkey -- a toy he had never seen before -- he could locate Mr. Monkey through the process of elimination when the monkey was placed near toys he was familiar with.\n Advertisement\n Perhaps even more exciting, Chaser was able to repeat this process of locating unfamiliar toys by name a full month later, after only being exposed to the new items once before. He was also able to understand verbs and objects used in different contexts; for example, Chaser demonstrated that he could put his nose to a ball, fetch, touch or take the ball depending on the command given.\n Just so you don't think that border collies have an edge, a Yorkshire terrier demonstrated his understanding of more than 120 words in a separate study [source: Hecht].\n But what about other animals who don't have such a close relationship with humans? Consider the case of Kanzi, a bonobo ape. Through years of work with his trainer, Kanzi was able to demonstrate his understanding of more than 3,000 English words [source: Raffaele].

I can assure you that you are still communicating with your dog but in a very different way, through body language. Are you relaxed, excited, frustrated or angry? Is your dog’s demeanor influenced or can you influence it, by your mood? In future, keep in mind what your body language says when you speak to your dog, as it can have a profound effect on the response.\n YOUR WISH IS MY COMMAND Telling a dog what to do by saying a command word, when it has no clue what that is, must be very frustrating to a dog.

Imagine walking into a room with no clue what is expected of you, the only way of knowing you’ve done the right thing is someone saying “Good Dog”.\n For example, I see people say the ‘stay command’ over and over again and then get upset with the dog when it breaks the stay.

Google favors newer content, whether it was recently published or thoroughly updated.\n Content freshness plays an even bigger role if you cover topics that involve news or trends. For such topics, Google prefers pages that provide the latest information.\n For instance, if you’re writing about a global health crisis, you want to publish content that contains recent news and researches.

While there are no particular favorites, here are some types of content that rank well on Google.\n Long-form content: Longer content tends to perform better than shorter content, as it provides more opportunities to incorporate keywords and answer user queries in detail.\n Content that provides value: Google favors content that provides value to users, such as informative articles, guides, tutorials, and reviews.\n Content that answers user queries: Google’s algorithms are designed to identify content that directly answers user queries. So, if your content incorporates long-tail keywords and provides direct answers to specific questions, it has a better chance of ranking higher.\n Content that is well-structured: Well-structured content, including the use of headings, subheadings, bullet points, and numbered lists, can improve the readability and accessibility of your content, making it more likely to rank.\n Content that is optimized for keywords: While keyword stuffing is not recommended and can get you flagged by Google for poor SEO practices, incorporating relevant keywords organically into your content can help it to rank higher on Google.\n Content that is mobile-friendly: Google prioritizes mobile-friendly content because more than half of the traffic comes from mobile. So, it is important to ensure that your website and content are optimized for mobile devices.\n Content that is visually appealing: High-quality images, videos, and infographics can improve the user experience and make your content more engaging and shareable.\n Fresh and updated content: Google rewards websites that regularly publish fresh and updated content.

If you do not index your page in Google, then it will not appear on their search engine results. However, when you successfully index your content, you will automatically get more traffic and any new content you post will be discovered far more quickly.\n Therefore, it is vital that you follow the indexing strategies below to ensure Google evaluates your content:\nEnsure that your most important pages are all indexed.\n Review the index using site:domain.com and eliminate any irrelevant pages, weak content or parameter URLs.\n Review the cache of your key pages using cache:domain.com and check to see if a Googlebot has recently crawled onto your website and discovered your most recent live content.\n Review the content itself.\n Length of the content\nThe ongoing and never-ending debate – how long should quality content be?\n You could ask 100 SEO experts and they would probably all give you a different answer. Some believe that longer content directly correlates with higher search rankings. Whereas others believe that short and sweet caters better for the short attention spans of today’s users.\n However, it’s what Google thinks that really matters, and they have been very clear about how they feel about the importance (or lack of it) when it comes to the word count in evaluating quality content.\n In fact, John Mueller, Webmaster Trends Analyst at Google, revealed in August 2019 that ‘word count is not a ranking factor’.\n Furthermore, the Google Quality Raters do not even count every word of each piece of content, so why are you bothering?\n The amount the content satisfies the user’s query\nThis is arguably the most important element in ensuring that Google ranks your content highly. They are looking for the content that provides the most standout solution to their users’ queries.\n If you provide the best answer for users, Google will rank you highly.

That means longer posts can actually hold your site back in search if they don’t say anything useful.\n Choose Your Target Audience: People, Personas, And Keywords\nYou also need to consider that person’s level of intent as well; are they looking for basic discovery information, or are they trying to buy something right now in as few clicks as possible? Your content will reflect that person and their different stages of user intent.\n Ideally, good content is mapped out before it is even created. It should connect the goals of your website/business and the content you are publishing with the goals of the users looking for it.\n If you’ve done your audience research and still aren’t sure how long your posts should be, you can get a better idea by looking at the content they’re already consuming.\n Search for keywords you want to target and examine the content that shows up on the first page. The length of those blog posts is a good source of insight into what it takes to answer those queries.\n Content should satisfy a user’s search query.

The choice of what queries to rank it for would immediately become obvious, right?\n That’s what semantic keywords do. Add them to ensure that your page doesn’t start showing up for irrelevant searches.\n b) Non-Keyword-Related On-Page Optimization Factors\nOn-page SEO is not just about sprinkling keywords across the page. The factors below help confirm a page’s credibility and authority too:\nExternal links: Linking out to other, relevant pages on the topic helps Google determine its topic further. Plus, it provides a good user experience. How? By positioning your content as a valuable resource.\n Internal links: Those links help you boost rankings in two ways. One, they allow search engines to find and crawl other pages on the site. And two, they show semantic relations between various pages, helping to determine its relevance to the search query better. As a rule, you should include at least 2-4 internal links per blog post\nContent’s length:Long content typically ranks better. That’s because, if done well, a longer blog post will always contain more exhaustive information on the topic, thus keeping a reader on your site longer. That’s called dwell time, and it’s an important ranking factor for the search engines\nMultimedia: Although not a requirement, multimedia elements like videos, diagrams, audio players can signal a page’s quality. It keeps readers on a page for longer just like longer content does. And in turn, it signals that they find the content valuable and worth pursuing.\n 3. Links\nFrom what you’ve read in this guide so far, you know that no page will rank without two factors — relevance and authority.\n In their quest to provide users with the most accurate answers, Google and other search engines prioritize pages they consider the most relevant to their queries but also, popular.\n The first two areas — technical setup and content — focused on increasing relevance (though I admit, some of their elements can also help highlight the authority.)\n Links, however, are responsible for popularity.\n But before we talk more about how they work, here’s what SEOs mean when talking about links.", "date": "NA"}, {"doc_id": "d7", "title": "What Are The Key Benefits to Long-Form Content | Content Creation ...", "url": "https://www.crowdcontent.com/blog/seo/is-long-form-content-the-way-to-go/", "snippet": "2. Longer Visitor Engagement\nIf you post information-rich content that’s worth reading, chances are good that visitors to your site will linger longer and come back more often. This is particularly important when readers reach your site through Google search results because the time spent on your page essentially tells Google that you’ve given searchers what they were looking for, letting Google adjust search rankings for future searches.\n3. Improved Conversion\nForbes notes that companies, such as Crazy Egg, were able to improve their conversion rates significantly by using long-form content. In the case of Crazy Egg, conversion rates increased by more than 30%.\n4. Establishing Your Site as an Authority\nBy providing high-quality long-form content on your blog or website, you bring credibility to your brand. Eventually, this credibility establishes your site or brand as an authority in your industry or subject matter, which can ultimately lead to better name recognition and more online sales.\n5. More Social Media Shares\n According to Search Engine Land, long-form has historically outperformed short-form content when it comes to social media shareability. According to a study conducted by Quick Sprout, posts greater than 1,500 words receive significantly more social shares and likes than shorter posts. The upshot of enhanced social media engagement is new readers and site growth.\n Another benefit of longer content is a higher percentage of backlinks, which can provide more organic traffic. To encourage backlinking, your content should entice link creators to view it as valuable enough to link to or even to use as background information for their own articles.\n Since shorter content, by its nature, provides less information, it’s often considered less valuable, resulting in few, if any, backlinks. Content that takes a deep dive into its subject matter is almost guaranteed to generate more backlinks, which in turn contribute to better search engine rankings.\n Tips for Creating Long-Form Content\nWhile the benefits of long-form content are undeniable, it’s important not to lose focus on quality.

As a result, longer content ranks higher and gets more organic traffic.\n Once again, our data doesn’t really back this up.\n If you take another look at the graph above, you’ll notice that it cuts off at 2,000 words. That’s because we found a moderate negative correlation between word count and organic traffic for posts longer than 2,000 words. In other words, the average 10,000-word post gets less search traffic than the average 2,000-word post.\n Of course, it could be the case that Google favors longer content up to 2,000 words, but we don’t see much merit in that argument.

These freedoms support other fundamental rights, such as to peaceful assembly, to participate in public affairs, and to freedom of religion. It is undeniable that digital media, including social media, have bolstered the right to seek, receive and impart information and ideas. Therefore, legislative efforts to regulate free expression unsurprisingly raise concerns that attempts to curb hate speech may silence dissent and opposition.\n To counter hate speech, the United Nations supports more positive speech and upholds respect for freedom of expression as the norm. Therefore, any restrictions must be an exception and seek to prevent harm and ensure equality or the public participation of all. Alongside the relevant international human rights law provisions, the UN Rabat Plan of Action provides key guidance to States on the difference between freedom of expression and “incitement” (to discrimination, hostility and violence), which is prohibited under criminal law. Determining when the potential of harm is high enough to justify prohibiting speech is still the subject of much debate. But States can also use alternative tools – such as education and promoting counter-messages – to address the whole spectrum of hateful expression, both on and offline.\n “Addressing hate speech does not mean limiting or prohibiting freedom of speech.

Generally, however, hate speech is any form of expression through which speakers intend to vilify, humiliate, or incite hatred against a group or a class of persons on the basis of race, religion, skin color sexual identity, gender identity, ethnicity, disability, or national origin. 1\nIn the United States, hate speech is protected by the First Amendment. Courts extend this protection on the grounds that the First Amendment requires the government to strictly protect robust debate on matters of public concern even when such debate devolves into distasteful, offensive, or hateful speech that causes others to feel grief, anger, or fear. (The Supreme Court's decision in Snyder v. Phelps provides an example of this legal reasoning.) Under current First Amendment jurisprudence, hate speech can only be criminalized when it directly incites imminent criminal activity or consists of specific threats of violence targeted against a person or group.\n Hate Crime\nFor the purposes of collecting statistics, the FBI has defined a hate crime as a “criminal offense against a person or property motivated in whole or in part by an offender’s bias against a race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, ethnicity, gender, or gender identity,” including skin color and national origin. Hate crimes are overt acts that can include acts of violence against persons or property, violation or deprivation of civil rights, certain \"true threats,\" or acts of intimidation, or conspiracy to commit these crimes. The Supreme Court has upheld laws that either criminalize these acts or impose a harsher punishment when it can be proven that the defendant targeted the victim because of the victim's race, ethnicity, identity, or beliefs. A hate crime is more than than offensive speech or conduct; it is specific criminal behavior that ranges from property crimes like vandalism and arson to acts of intimidation, assault, and murder.", "date": "NA"}, {"doc_id": "d3", "title": "Hate speech in the United States - Wikipedia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech_in_the_United_States", "snippet": "Hate speech in the United States cannot be directly regulated by the government due to the fundamental right to freedom of speech protected by the Constitution.[1] While \"hate speech\" is not a legal term in the United States, the U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled that most of what would qualify as hate speech in other western countries is legally protected speech under the First Amendment. In a Supreme Court case on the issue, Matal v. Tam (2017), the justices unanimously reaffirmed that there is effectively no \"hate speech\" exception to the free speech rights protected by the First Amendment and that the U.S. government may not discriminate against speech on the basis of the speaker's viewpoint.[2]\nIn academic circles, there has been debate over freedom of speech, hate speech, and hate speech legislation.[3] Other forms of speech have lesser protection under court interpretations of the First Amendment, including commercial speech, \"fighting words\", and obscenity.\n The protection of civil liberties, including freedom of speech, was not written into the original 1788 Constitution of the United States but was added two years later with the Bill of Rights, implemented as several amendments to the Constitution. The First Amendment, ratified December 15, 1791, provides (in relevant part) that \"Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press\".

But if only popular ideas were protected, we wouldn’t need a First Amendment. History teaches that the first target of government repression is never the last. If we do not come to the defense of the free speech rights of the most unpopular among us, even if their views are antithetical to the very freedom the First Amendment stands for, then no one’s liberty will be secure. In that sense, all First Amendment rights are “indivisible.”\n Censoring so-called hate speech also runs counter to the long-term interests of the most frequent victims of hate: racial, ethnic, religious and sexual minorities. We should not give the government the power to decide which opinions are hateful, for history has taught us that government is more apt to use this power to prosecute minorities than to protect them. As one federal judge has put it, tolerating hateful speech is “the best protection we have against any Nazi-type regime in this country.”\n At the same time, freedom of speech does not prevent punishing conduct that intimidates, harasses, or threatens another person, even if words are used. Threatening phone calls, for example, are not constitutionally protected.\n SPEECH & NATIONAL SECURITY\nThe Supreme Court has recognized the government’s interest in keeping some information secret, such as wartime troop deployments. But the Court has never actually upheld an injunction against speech on national security grounds. Two lessons can be learned from this historical fact. First, the amount of speech that can be curtailed in the interest of national security is very limited. And second, the government has historically overused the concept of “national security” to shield itself from criticism, and to discourage public discussion of controversial policies or decisions.\n In 1971, the publication of the “Pentagon Papers” by the New York Times brought the conflicting claims of free speech and national security to a head.", "date": "NA"}, {"doc_id": "d5", "title": "Free Speech Can Be Messy, but We Need It | ACLU", "url": "https://www.aclu.org/news/free-speech/free-speech-can-be-messy-we-need-it", "snippet": "Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me.\n Does anyone as an adult actually believe this?

Respect for the autonomy rights of speakers is a commitment of liberal justice, but it is not the only commitment. When the non-violation of the autonomy rights of speakers foreseeably leads to policies which will violate other, foundational, commitments of liberal justice such as the equal basic rights of citizens, it is unclear that violating the autonomy rights of speakers is unjustified, all things considered. My position here is, I believe, consistent with Rawls’s views about the priority of a coherent scheme of basic liberties. Priority for a scheme of liberties rather than for any one liberty ‘implies in practice that a basic liberty can be limited or denied solely for the sake of one or more other basic liberties, [but never] for reasons of public good or of perfectionist values’ (Rawls (1993, p. 295).\n Having suggested that restrictions on this category of hate speech do not violate unjustly free speech rights, and in light of the obvious harms of such speech, I conclude that this hate speech category is clearly covered as political speech, but nonetheless unprotected and therefore regulable. I would stress, however, that my position is silent on whether such speech should be regulated, and is certainly silent on the authority question—who should decide when speech properly counts as falling within this category, in virtue of its foreseeably leading to the adoption of policies which exclude or eliminate identifiable racial or religious groups.

The Supreme Court never has created a category of speech that is defined by its hateful conduct, labeled it hate speech, and said that that is categorically excluded by the first amendment. Speech cannot be punished just because of its hateful content. But when you get beyond content and look at context, speech with a hateful message may be punished, if in a particular context it directly causes certain specific, imminent, serious harm — such as a genuine threat that means to instill a reasonable fear on the part of the person at whom the threat is targeted that he or she is going be subject to violence.\n On feeling physically threatened by hateful speech\nNot only threatened. You can feel emotionally disturbed. You can feel psychic trauma, which can have physiological manifestations. You can feel silenced.

Some free speech advocates prefer an open marketplace of ideas, where no expression is restricted. They consider that the best response to harmful speech is through debate that lets different ideas freely challenge it. Others argue that restrictions on hate speech are vital to the protection of minority communities from the harm that such speech causes.2\nDifferent approaches to what is acceptable speech can be seen around the world. The United States of America has traditionally been a country where the constitutional protection of free speech is vigorously defended.3 And yet, even there, many restrictions on free speech do exist, such as those against speech that incites “imminent lawless action”4 and those that censor obscenity.5\nSome countries show a greater acceptance than others for prohibiting certain forms of speech and even the expression of certain opinions. For instance, some European countries have passed laws in accordance with a European Union Council decision to make it a punishable offence not only to incite hatred, but also to publicly deny crimes of genocide (e.g., the Holocaust) or war crimes.6 In other countries, strict limitations on free speech may go as far as to impose the death penalty for such crimes as apostasy, blasphemy or other statements that may be perceived to be opposed to the dominant religion.7\nIn Canada, various laws at the federal, provincial and territorial levels impose restrictions on the freedom of expression guaranteed by section 2(b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.8 For instance, under the Criminal Code,9 such actions as defamatory libel, counselling suicide, perjury and fraud are prohibited. In 1990, then Justice of the Supreme Court of Canada Antonio Lamer described offences that address forms of speech or expression as falling under the following categories:\noffences against the public order, offences related to falsehood, offences against the person and reputation, offences against the administration of law and justice, and offences related to public morals and disorderly conduct.", "date": "NA"}]}
