Many of the studies were based in the United Kingdom, while others were in U.S. cities such as Cincinnati and New York. The analysis found that surveillance systems were most effective in parking lots, where their use resulted in a 51% decrease in crime. Systems in other public settings had some effect on crime — a 7% decrease in city centers and in public housing communities, and a 23% drop in public transit systems — but the results weren’t statistically significant. When sorted by country, systems in the United Kingdom accounted for the majority of the decrease; the drop in other countries was insignificant. The study concludes that while surveillance cameras can be effective in specific contexts such as parking lots and public-transit systems, the potential financial and societal costs require greater research.\n Abstract: “We examine the impacts of public surveillance cameras on crime and disorder in Schenectady, N.Y., a medium-sized city in the northeastern United States.", "date": "NA"}, {"doc_id": "d4", "title": "How a Consumer LPR Company, Homeowners, and Police ...", "url": "https://cops.usdoj.gov/html/dispatch/05-2020/cobb.html", "snippet": "Surprisingly, multiple alerts were sent the first day, and over a six-month period, dispatch handled approximately 900 calls related to the cameras.\n Over time, many arrests were made. After one year, the data collected showed dramatic reductions in crime: reductions of 45 percent in robberies, 45 percent in burglaries, and 62 percent in thefts from autos (compared to a three-year average). Though not all categories lowered this substantially, total crime dropped by 35 percent. Â\n It was clear that the program could be a success in other neighborhoods as wellâand now there was hard data to demonstrate Flock Safety’s effectiveness in reducing crime. But there were remaining challenges to HOA acceptance: privacy concerns and funding.\n Resolving Funding and Privacy Challenges\nTo address privacy concerns, the department worked with county commissioners, HOA leaders, and community groups to determine best practices, gathering input from residents to develop policies and procedures. Most importantly, they made sure that the public knew how the CCPD was using the data and what the CCPD was doing to protect privacy.\n Cost was another matter. Paying for the cameras wasn’t a problem for HOAs and businesses in affluent areas. But high crime rates tend to plague lower socioeconomic areas where funding could be more of a challenge.

But the city's police department dropped the technology two years later when it failed to result in a single arrest. The use of video surveillance was considered by the Oakland, Calif., police chief, but he ultimately found that \"there is no conclusive way to establish that the presence of video surveillance resulted in the prevention or reduction of crime. \"\n\"They are good forensic tools — after something happens, they'll tell you what happened,\" said Jim Harper, the director of information policy studies at the Cato Institute. \"And in the rare case where a terrorism case fails, they can be useful to help track down the perpetrators.

The ordinance requirements in some cities mandate that a decal be posted on the passenger windows to make passengers aware that they are under surveillance. Consistent with Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design Theory, would-be perpetrators are less likely to commit a crime while under surveillance.12\nAnother crucial component to ensure optimal performance of security cameras is maintaining cameras according to manufacturer's instructions and not allowing security cameras to be intentionally disabled. Security cameras mandated by ordinance are checked for functioning at yearly inspections organized by city regulators, if not more frequently, when taxicab vehicles are checked for safety. Two of the three taxicab driver homicides that occurred in camera cities in 2010 had disabled cameras in their taxicabs (International Association of Transportation Regulators, personal communication, 2011). Specifically, the only city that experienced an increase in number of homicides after camera installation (City 4) was the city with the two murdered taxicab drivers whose cameras were disabled.\n All six taxicab driver homicides post-installation occurred in camera cities where cameras are required by company policy instead of by city ordinance. Although company policies for security camera installation may be effective, municipal ordinances requiring that all taxicabs be equipped with operating security cameras may be more effective. Such ordinances would ensure that individual owner–operated taxicabs and smaller businesses would use cameras, as do the nationally recognized taxicab companies that make up a large share of the market. Because deterrence through identification is one effect of camera installation, it is important that news reports mention the presence of a camera in the taxicab of a murdered driver, and post photos of potential suspects, so that potential perpetrators are aware of the possibility of being identified by surveillance cameras.\n The lack of an observed reduction in taxicab driver homicides in partition cities was unexpected. Partitions were implemented citywide because of ordinance requirements before 1996 in six of the seven cities examined. These were typically the cities that were experiencing the highest number of taxicab driver homicides,", "date": "NA"}]}

But when my young daughter asked me why not, I didn’t have an answer. So, why can other species like cats, dogs and people vomit but not horses?\n A: This question actually breaks down into two parts: Why is it physically impossible (or at least very difficult) for horses to vomit? And why should that be?\nHorses have a number of key physiological differences to ensure that any food they ingest takes only a one-way trip.\n Vomiting (emesis) is a complex physiological event that requires a closely coordinated sequence of reflexive motions. When you are going to throw up, you draw a deep breath, your vocal cords close, your larynx rises, and the soft palate shifts to close off your airways. Then your diaphragm contracts downward, which loosens pressure on the lower esophagus and the sphincter where it enters the stomach. Next, the muscles of the abdominal wall contract spasmodically, which puts sudden pressure on the stomach. With the upward “doors” open, the contents have a clear exit pathway. All of these separate actions happen involuntarily, of course, controlled by distinct “vomiting centers” in the brain.\n Horses, however, have a number of key physiological differences to ensure that any food they ingest takes only a one-way trip. For example, the muscles of the equine lower esophageal sphincter are much stronger than in other animals, making it nearly impossible to open that valve under backward pressure from the stomach. Also, the equine esophagus joins the stomach at a much lower angle than in many animals, so when the stomach is distended, as with gas, it presses against the valve in such a way that holds it even more tightly closed. And, located deep within the rib cage, the equine stomach cannot be readily squeezed by the abdominal muscles.", "date": "NA"}, {"doc_id": "d2", "title": "Physiology of Vomiting", "url": "http://www.vivo.colostate.edu/hbooks/pathphys/digestion/stomach/vomiting.html", "snippet": "With the pylorus closed and the esophagus relatively open, the route of exit is clear.\n The series of events described seems to be typical for humans and many animals, but is not inevitable. Vomition occasionally occurs abruptly and in the absense of premonitory signs - this situation is often referred to as projectile vomiting. A common cause of projectile vomiting is gastric outlet obstruction, often a result of the ingestion of foreign bodies.\n An activity related to but clearly distinct from vomiting is regurgitation, which is the passive expulsion of ingested material out of the mouth - this often occurs even before the ingesta has reached the stomach and is usually a result of esophageal disease. Regurgitation also is a normal component of digestion in ruminants.\n There is also considerable variability among species in the propensity for vomition. Rats reportedly do not vomit. Cattle and horses vomit rarely - this is usually an ominous sign and most frequently a result of acute gastric distension. Carnivores such as dogs and cats vomit frequently, often in response to such trivial stimuli as finding themselves on a clean carpet. Humans fall between these extremes, and interestingly, rare individuals have been identified that seem to be incapable of vomiting due to congenital abnormalities in the vomition centers of the brainstem.\n Control of Vomition\nThe complex, almost sterotypical set of activities that culminate in vomiting suggest that control is central, which indeed has been shown to be true. Within the brainstem are two anatomically and functionally distinct units that control vomiting:\nBilateral vomition centers in the reticular formation of the medulla integrate signals from a large number of outlying sources and their excitement is ultimately what triggers vomition. Electric stimulation of these centers induces vomiting, while destruction of the vomition centers renders animals very resistant to emetic drugs.", "date": "NA"}, {"doc_id": "d3", "title": "Can Horses Throw Up?

Familiarizing yourself with potential signs of injury or illness allows you to get timely help from a professional veterinarian that could save your horses’ life. One area that is especially important to educate yourself on is the digestive health of your horse.\n Can horses throw up? ​The way a horse’s digestive system is designed makes it nearly impossible for them to throw up, even if they are in extreme intestinal distress. In the rare occurrence that a horse vomits, it is almost always fatal, although there are a few instances where a horse has reached a full recovery after this unlikely event.\n With vomiting being such a common reaction for both humans and other animals, it seems odd that a horse would not have this ability. However, there are several reasons why the horse was designed in this way.\n In this post, we will discuss some of the nitty-gritty details surrounding your horse’s digestive system as well as some of the signs that they may be experiencing a form of intestinal distress.\n Understanding Why Horses Rarely Vomit\nSeveral scientific reasons explain why horses simply cannot vomit. A horse’s digestive system is comprised of several different parts, similar to that of a human. As they swallow their food, it travels down their esophagus where it eventually joins the stomach.\n Located at this intersection is the esophageal sphincter muscle. This muscle relaxes when a horse is eating, allowing food to enter the stomach. Although humans also possess this muscle, it is much stronger in a horse. The strength of the esophageal sphincter muscle, along with the position of the stomach, prevents the valve from opening backward.\n The angle at which the esophagus of a horse joins the stomach is much lower than that of other animals. When your horse experiences indigestion and bloating, the stomach presses up against the valve causing it to remain closed.", "date": "NA"}, {"doc_id": "d4", "title": "Nature curiosity: Why don't squirrels throw up? | Forest Preserve ...", "url": "https://www.reconnectwithnature.org/news-events/the-buzz/nature-curiosity-why-dont-squirrels-throw-up/", "snippet": "The Buzz\nNature curiosity: Why don't squirrels throw up?\nVomiting is one of the most universally dreaded human behaviors. Some people even fear it, a condition called emetophobia. And while vomiting is despised by most, it can be useful in helping rid our bodies of dangerous substances that could otherwise harm us or make us sick.\n Scientists have long known that rodents aren't able to vomit, but the reason behind it has only more recently been understood, according to Smithsonian. In particular, a study into why rodents don't vomit has focused on their brains as well as the anatomy of their digestive systems.\n A 2013 study by University of Pittsburgh neurobiologists on rodents and their inability to vomit investigated their brain stems by giving rodents substances that are known to trigger nausea and vomiting in other animals. The rodents in the study did not exhibit any of the mouth, throat, shoulder and nerve activity normally associated with throwing up, so the researchers concluded the rodents' brains do not have the neurological circuits that allow for vomiting.\n The anatomy of their abdominal area and digestive tract also contributes to the inability to vomit. For example, their diaphragms are weaker than those of other species, and their stomachs are not designed in a way that allows the contents to easily move up through the esophagus, according to the study.\n The inability to vomit isn't necessarily beneficial. In fact, it's precisely the reason rat poison is effective for rodent control. Most mammals, after ingesting a poisonous or toxic substance, will vomit. Rats and rodents cannot, so the poison then quickly kills the animals.\n While most mammals are able to vomit, rodents aren't the only exception. Horses don't throw up either.

These will remain inside the body and put their health at risk and, in some cases, can even lead to death.\n Domestic Horses are more exposed to harmful substances.\n As we have mentioned earlier in this article, when horses are in their natural environment, they will rarely need to vomit.\n But this is not the case with most horses today because they are exposed to toxic substances that would usually not exist in their natural environment.\n Following are some of the risks to which horses are exposed nowadays.\n Animal feed that is intended for other species and contaminated with substances that are toxic to horses, such as cacao by-products or antibiotic additives.\n Poisonous plants, like, for example, oleander and yew.\n Pesticides in the stables and herbicides in the fields.\n Rotting hay and moldy corn.\n Everyone who takes care of horses should know about these risks and make sure they don’t exist in their environment.\n When to Call the Veterinarian\nIf you notice your horse is not feeling well and suspect that he has ingested something toxic, you should not try to solve this on your own. This is an emergency, and you should call your veterinarian immediately.\n Meanwhile, until the veterinarian arrives, you should keep the horse away from the toxic substance and make sure he has fresh water available to drink.\n You should never give your horse anything to make him vomit because this will cause major stomach spasms, which can lead to death.\n How The Vet Can Help The Horse Expel Harmful Substances\nWhen the veterinarian arrives, he will ask you to describe what happened and examine the horse to evaluate the situation’s severity.", "date": "NA"}, {"doc_id": "d6", "title": "Motion Sickness, Trailer Loading Troubles, and Your Horse – The ...", "url": "https://thehorse.com/165668/motion-sickness-trailer-loading-troubles-and-your-horse/", "snippet": "Emesis (vomiting) is also a GI sign of motion sickness, but horses can’t vomit.\n A video you shared shows that your gelding was relatively easy to load but his behavior problems began as soon as the trailer started to move. He scrambled, leaned against the trailer wall and divider, raised his head and pulled back against the lead rope, dropped his hindquarters with legs splayed, and shifted position frequently. After a few minutes he was lathered in sweat. These behaviors suggest that he is struggling to maintain balance, even though the trailer is moving slowly and has nonskid flooring. The balance challenges and possible motion sickness would understandably also make your horse nervous.\n Why do animals get motion sickness?\n Experts don’t know exactly why some animals get motion sickness. A leading theory is that it’s caused by conflicting sensory input from the visual system (eyes), vestibular system (ears), and proprioceptors (joints). One sensory system is telling the horse that its moving, but another system is telling the horse that its standing still; the contradictory signals to the brain cause motion sickness. This would be similar to becoming carsick.\n A second theory is that motion sickness is caused by vehicle movement and the resulting postural instability. This would be like standing up in a small boat on rough seas. Santurtun and Phillips found evidence supporting the second theory2; livestock with motion sickness made persistent efforts to control and stabilize their balance during transport. A horse needs to make adjustments to stay standing upright in a moving vehicle, because the “ground” is unstable. They’ll typically brace themselves by splaying their legs and raising their heads and necks1, which describes your horse’s stance exactly. Heart rate increases during trailering, so not only are these horses unbalanced, they also appear to be stressed out.\n How is motion sickness managed?\nTo manage motion sickness, an important first step is to reduce vehicle movement.", "date": "NA"}]}

My Inner Geek googled around for more detail about why this is so, and came up with this.\n From http://www.lallemand.com/BakerYeastNA/eng/PDFs/LBU%20PDF%20FILES/1_6DRYYE.PDF\n\"When yeast is dried the cell membrane\nbecomes more porous than usual. During\nrehydration the cell membrane recovers,\nbut while this is occurring cell constituents\ncan dissolve in the dough water. The optimum\ntemperature for membrane recovery\nis about 104°F.\n Warm rehydration maximizes dry yeast\nperformance by quickly reforming the cell\nmembrane. Cold rehydration hurts performance\nby slowing down the recovery of the\ncell membrane and allowing more cell constituents\nto escape or “leach.” The effect is\nnot that great between 70° and 100°F, but\nat lower temperatures up to half of the yeast\ncells’ soluble components can be lost.\n Leaching affects yeast activity because\nalthough most of the enzymes remain, the\nsolubles which promoted the activity of the\nenzymes are depleted. Leaching also affects\ndough consistency because glutathione is released.\n This contributes to dough slackening\nwhich can be desirable at low levels in\nsome applications but undesirable in others. \"\nYou can put yeast doughs in a very cold refrigerator or freezer, and on being thawed/returned to room temperature, they rise just fine. Same with sourdough starters that have been refrigerated or frozen. So being in the presence of water and cold hasn't killed the yeast--or at least not all of it--in those cases. How is putting dry yeast into cold water different? I get that the yeast won't really activate until it reaches a certain temperature, but have you really killed it?\n Cold water negatively impacts the yeast cells' rehydration process which must take place within a particular temperature range to be successful.", "date": "NA"}, {"doc_id": "d8", "title": "Problem with frozen no-knead dough.. - New York Style - Pizza ...", "url": "https://www.pizzamaking.com/forum/index.php?topic=49384.0", "snippet": "You might try adding a couple percent of sugar to dough that you plan on browning and see if that helps at all. What racks are you baking on? I've tried baking on both the bottom and top rack with a steel and find I get the best cornice browning on the top rack.\n Usually when one wants to make a dough that is to be frozen, the common practice (the one used by commercial producers of frozen dough balls) is to dramatically increase the amount of yeast. This is done because freezing will kill some of the yeast. Typically, the amount of yeast is doubled or even tripled from what one would use to make a non-frozen dough. However, in your case, increasing the amount of yeast was not an option because the dough recipe you used calls for fermenting the dough at room temperature for 18 hours. That is why the amount of yeast in that recipe (around 0.20%) is so small. Anything much greater than that would probably cause overfermentation. Also, the salt level is on the high side. That is typical of what is used with long, room temperature fermented doughs, with a good example being room temperature fermented Neapolitan style doughs. The high level of salt (2.23% in your case) helps control the rate of fermentation (by suppressing yeast performance) so that the dough doesn't ferment too fast.\n After the 18 hours of room temperature fermentation, you might have been able to successfully freeze the dough balls had you kept any further fermentation of the dough to a minimum.

If your water is too cold the yeast won't activate. If it's too hot it will kill the yeast. Technically the water temperature should be around 116 degrees F. Most people don't measure the temperature.\n Think of the temperature of water if you were to bath a baby. You would want it to be warm enough but not hot.\n How do you know if it worked?

As it turns out, freezing temperatures do not kill all the yeast and lactic acid bacteria in a preferment. Some die, but most remain dormant while frozen. The key is to know how to “wake it up” properly and to feed it well so it comes back strong and ready to leaven.\n There are a lot of great reasons to try freezing your sourdough starter. Using a frozen preferment affords an almost instant starter; even with the added thawing and feeding time required, it provides a significant time savings over starting one from scratch. Having a preferment ready to go is convenient—you can freeze it in portions and just thaw what you need—and frees you from a feeding schedule. There’s no need to worry about entrusting someone with your starter when you go on vacation.\n Our experiments demonstrated that a frozen levain will perform well for up to 2 weeks after freezing it. Eventually the ice crystals in the frozen preferment grow big enough to damage the yeasts and bacteria, rendering them useless for leavening. If you have levain that has been frozen for more than 2 weeks, you can still use it in combination with commercial yeast. The less-active levain will still provide your bread with complex flavor, and the yeast makes the dough rise.\n Tips for Freezing Levain\nWorking with frozen levain is simple, although freezing your starter involves more than throwing it in a jar and stashing it in the freezer.

The brain is like a muscle; you should exercise it every day. Brain training is important to keep your mind sharp for a longer period of time, since cognitive decline can be an unavoidable part of aging.\n Which brain games are most helpful?\n There are a variety of activities that could be classified as “brain games,” which are anything that stimulates your brain. Each practice can improve different cognitive functions like memory, problem solving, and critical thinking. Brain games for critical thinking and problem solving include crossword puzzles, chess, Sudoku, or bridge. Mental training can also include creative outlets like drawing, playing an instrument, or learning a new language. Try to find a variety of mentally stimulating activities that you enjoy so you will be more likely to keep up with the activities.\n How often should you practice brain training?\n According to the American Psychological Association, people begin to see cognitive decline in perceptual speed — quickly comparing symbols, figures, or numbers for patterns — beginning in their 20s or 30s. People who participate in brain games for a few hours a week have experienced lasting benefits. Research suggests that once people learn to have better control over their attention and mental processing abilities, they can apply what they learned from the brain games into day-to-day activities.\n What are the benefits of brain games?\nMajor benefits are seen when you practice brain training because this allows for neuroplasticity to work its magic. Neuroplasticity is the ability of the brain to form and reorganize synaptic connections. One of the most researched benefits of mental games is the brain’s working memory, the part of short-term memory that is concerned with understanding concepts and languages faster.

The study authors also reached out to pharmaceutical companies and study authors for additional unpublished study data. All told, the data collection included 116,477 men and women, ages 18 and older, who had depression and who were treated for at least eight weeks.\n The researchers found that every type of antidepressant they studied was more effective at lessening symptoms of depression over time than placebo.

In contrast, among those with prior experience, drug–placebo differences were both significant and substantially larger than those reported in other clinical trials, whereas the combined differences for antidepressant-experienced and antidepressant-naive participants are in the same range of other clinical trials. Taken together, the data from both studies strongly suggest that prescriptions for antidepressants should not be given to depressed people who have never taken them before.\n What Is to Be Done?\nHow then shall we treat depression? One suggestion that has been made to me informally is to prescribe antidepressants as active placebos. An active placebo is a pharmacologically active substance that does not have specific activity for the condition being treated. Antidepressant medications have little or no pharmacological effects on depression or anxiety, but they do elicit a substantial placebo effect. Could we not use them as a means of capitalizing on the power of placebo?\n The problem with this suggestion is that treatment decisions need to be based on an assessment of risks, as well as benefits. The risks of antidepressant treatment include suicidal and violent aggressive behavior in adolescents and young adults; stroke, death from all causes, falls and fractures, and epileptic seizures in the elderly; and sexual dysfunction, withdrawal symptoms, diabetes, deep vein thrombosis, and gastrointestinal and intracranial bleeding in everyone else (55–62). One might argue that these risks might be worth taking for an effective treatment of severe depression, but are they worth risking for a treatment that has no benefit at all over placebo for first-time users?\nA second possibility would be to prescribe placebos. They are safe and effective, with relatively few nocebo side effects and no health risks.", "date": "NA"}, {"doc_id": "d8", "title": "Antidepressants: Do They \"Work\" or Don't They? - Scientific American", "url": "https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/antidepressants-do-they-work-or-dont-they/", "snippet": "To do so would risk reducing their profits.\n Some have suggested that critics of antidepressant efficacy should keep quiet and not publicize their work. The reasoning is that if the effectiveness of antidepressants depends in large part on the faith of patients and their doctors, then publicizing the fact that antidepressants appear to have only minimal efficacy as compared to placebos will have the practical effect of harming patients. But this is putting our heads in the sand. The history of medicine is littered with treatments initially thought effective that we now know to be ineffective at best and actually harmful at worst (For example, bloodletting contributed to the death of George Washington). To ignore the evidence, is to return to a pre-scientific form of medicine. In the long run, this will not be beneficial to patients.\n So what’s the bottom line? In clinical practice, many people suffering from depression improve after taking antidepressants. But the evidence indicates that much of that improvement is a placebo response. Antidepressants do work in the sense that many patients in clinical practice show substantial improvement. However, if the standard is efficacy in comparison to placebo, the best available scientific evidence suggests that antidepressants do not work very well. Given their cost and side effects, the psychiatric community and the general public should not be satisfied with antidepressant medications that provide only a marginal benefit over placebo.\n Indeed, as early as 1994, Brown University School of Medicine psychiatrist Walter Brown suggested treating mild to moderately depressed patients with placebos for an initial 4-6 week period, and then switching to active medications if patients did not improve. To surmount ethical concerns, Brown proposed prescribing placebos openly by informing patients that clinical trials showed that many depressed patients improved after being treated with placebos, and asking whether they would like to try a placebo initially. It’s been sixteen years since Brown offered up his radical prescription for harnessing the placebo effect in the treatment of depression.

In 2007, antidepressants ranked as the top class of medications dispensed in the United States, with an estimated 232.7 million antidepressant prescriptions and an estimated sale of $11.9 billion.1 However, a recent meta-analysis suggests that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) may not be more effective than placebo.2 Selective publication of positive studies appears to have greatly overstated the benefits of these drugs.3\nAlthough we have regularly witnessed apparent benefits of SSRIs and SNRIs in patients with depression, family physicians should also recognize the limitations of data regarding these drugs and call for further research and discussion. Could the dramatic responses to antidepressant medications be a placebo effect in which providers actively listen and patients feel understood, gain insight, believe in their treatment plan, feel motivated to change their lifestyle or social situation, or perhaps some combination?4 Should we reintroduce the N-of-1 trials, in which each patient is their own “study” comparing placebo with active medication over some period of time, in order to identify the small proportion of patients who may benefit from SSRIs or SNRIs?\n The majority of depression studies measure changes in depression scores that have uncertain clinical significance. Remission rates are rarely measured, and most studies are of short duration (often as little as 24 weeks of follow-up). We need to help researchers identify outcome measures that are more meaningful in the primary care setting.\n Perhaps physicians should prescribe SSRIs and SNRIs only after fully disclosing to their patients that the drugs may be acting through the placebo effect and sharing the known side effects.5,6 Clearly, more research is needed.

What is it that actually makes therapy so effective at treating mental illness — and what could a placebo share in common?\n In the 1980s, the National Institute of Mental Health launched the Treatment of Depression Collaborative Research Program, a large-scale randomized control trial that eventually formed the scientific basis for the belief that therapy is effective. The study showed that interpersonal therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy worked equivalently well to antidepressants for reducing the symptoms of depression.\n In the following three decades, psychotherapy — especially short-term, manualized therapy of the kind tested in the study — has exploded in popularity as a front-line treatment for mental illness.\n Still, there’s more to the story.\n A closer look at the NIMH-TDCRP’s results reveals a curious phenomenon: The therapies and antidepressants barely outperform placebo treatment. On the 54 point Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, CBT does, on average, 1.2 points better than a sugar pill combined with weekly meetings with a psychiatrist.\n This is not to say that therapy didn’t work — in all treatment groups, depression symptoms were reduced from severe to mild. Rather, it is to say that there was nothing specifically effective about the psychotherapies: A sugar pill and weekly meetings with a psychiatrist to discuss the effects of the ‘treatment’ were also comparably effective.\n So why is a sugar pill performing on the level of state of the art therapy and antidepressants?

A. H. Walker, and Stephenson Yang of the University of Victoria and the University of British Columbia.[59] Although they were cautious about claiming a planetary detection, their radial-velocity observations suggested that a planet orbits the star Gamma Cephei. Partly because the observations were at the very limits of instrumental capabilities at the time, astronomers remained skeptical for several years about this and other similar observations. It was thought some of the apparent planets might instead have been brown dwarfs, objects intermediate in mass between planets and stars. In 1990, additional observations were published that supported the existence of the planet orbiting Gamma Cephei,[60] but subsequent work in 1992 again raised serious doubts.[61] Finally, in 2003, improved techniques allowed the planet's existence to be confirmed.[62]\n On 9 January 1992, radio astronomers Aleksander Wolszczan and Dale Frail announced the discovery of two planets orbiting the pulsarPSR 1257+12.[45] This discovery was confirmed, and is generally considered to be the first definitive detection of exoplanets. Follow-up observations solidified these results, and confirmation of a third planet in 1994 revived the topic in the popular press.[63] These pulsar planets are thought to have formed from the unusual remnants of the supernova that produced the pulsar, in a second round of planet formation, or else to be the remaining rocky cores of gas giants that somehow survived the supernova and then decayed into their current orbits.

Through measuring the periodic pulses coming from a neutron star, we could see that the pulses would regularly speed up, then return to normal speed, then slow down, and then return to normal speed again, over and over. The fact that these pulses changed with the same period and amplitude told us that there were massive companions in these pulsar systems, and by measuring the pulse timing, we could infer the masses of these companions: they were definitively planets.\n Similarly, we could observe the periodic redshifting and blueshifting of the light from individual stars, which also revealed the presence of massive planets, which “tugged”", "date": "Mar 24, 2022"}, {"doc_id": "d7", "title": "Video: NASA Confirms 5000 Exoplanets - and Counting", "url": "https://science.nasa.gov/resource/video-nasa-confirms-5000-exoplanets-and-counting/", "snippet": "Video: NASA Confirms 5,000 Exoplanets — and Counting\nUsing powerful telescopes, in space and on the ground, astronomers have now confirmed more than 5,000 exoplanets – planets beyond our solar system.

What does that mean?\n Signed,\nJenny L.\nDear Jenny L.,\nMarket capitalization, or market cap, is an investing term used to describe the size of a publicly traded company. It’s based on a simple formula that multiplies the number of shares of stock in a company by its share price.\n Here’s a basic example: Say you have a company with 1,000 shares of stock and each share trades for $10. Then the company’s market cap is $10,000.\n Apple’s $3 trillion market cap is absolutely astounding. The company has more than 16 billion outstanding shares of stock that during the last calendar year traded as high as $181 and as low as $116.\n One thing to remember is that a company’s market cap is always changing, along with its share price. In fact, Apple only temporarily reached its $3 trillion market cap on Jan. 3, 2022, when its share price briefly hit $182.86. Then the share price dropped 85 cents, causing the company’s market cap to close the trading day a few billion shy of $3 trillion. Yep, 85 cents add up quickly when multiplied by a number with nine zeros.\n Nevertheless, Apple is the first U.S. company to reach a $3 trillion valuation.

One such term is 'public corporations by market capitalization'. This term refers to a list of companies that are publicly traded, ranked by their total market value. This is a crucial concept for traders as it gives them an insight into the financial health and size of a company, which can greatly influence investment decisions.\n Market capitalization, often referred to as 'market cap', is the total dollar market value of a company's outstanding shares of stock. It is calculated by multiplying a company's outstanding shares by the current market price of one share. The companies with the largest market cap are typically considered to be the most stable and secure for investment, with less risk of bankruptcy or financial trouble.\n Understanding Market Capitalization\nMarket capitalization is a key metric in determining the value of a company. It provides an estimate of what a company is worth on the open market, as well as a benchmark for investors to use in comparing the value of different companies. Market cap is often used in financial news and reports to give a sense of a company's size and growth potential.\n While market cap gives a snapshot of a company's value, it's important to note that it doesn't tell the whole story. It doesn't account for a company's debt or other liabilities and it doesn't give any indication of a company's future performance or growth potential. Therefore, while it's a useful metric, it should be used in conjunction with other financial indicators when evaluating a company's worth.\n Calculating Market Capitalization\nCalculating market capitalization is straightforward. It's simply the current share price of a company multiplied by the total number of its outstanding shares. For example, if a company has 1 million shares outstanding and the current share price is $20, the market cap would be $20 million.\n However, it's important to note that market cap can change frequently as the share price fluctuates. Therefore, the market cap of a company at any given moment may not be the same as it was a day, a week, or a month ago.", "date": "Jul 30, 2024"}, {"doc_id": "d9", "title": "Which Companies Belong to the Elite Trillion-Dollar Club?", "url": "https://www.visualcapitalist.com/which-companies-belong-to-the-elite-trillion-dollar-club/", "snippet": "Which Companies Belong to the Elite Trillion-Dollar Club?\nJust a handful of publicly-traded companies have managed to achieve $1 trillion or more in market capitalization—only seven, to be precise.\n We pull data from Companies Market Cap to find out which familiar names are breaking the 13-digit barrier—and who else is waiting in the wings.\n The Major Players in the Game\nApple, Microsoft, and Saudi Aramco are the three companies to have shattered the $2T market cap milestone to date, leaving others in the dust.

Find facts (not fiction) about our most important feast day from The Old Farmer’s Almanac—first published in George Washington’s time!\n When Is Thanksgiving 2025?\nThe United States celebrates Thanksgiving as a national holiday on the fourth Thursday in November. In 2025, Thanksgiving will be observed on Thursday, November 27.\n Thanksgiving has been held on the fourth Thursday in November since 1941, which means that the date of the holiday shifts each year. The earliest Thanksgiving can occur is November 22; the latest is November 28.\nHistory of Thanksgiving\nNative Americans in North America celebrated harvest festivals for centuries before a Thanksgiving federal holiday was formally established in the United States. Colonial services for these festivals date back to the late 16th century. The autumnal feasts celebrated the harvest of crops after a season of bountiful growth.\n In the 1600s, settlers in Massachusetts and Virginia held feasts to express gratitude for survival, fertile fields, and their faith. The Pilgrims in Plymouth, Massachusetts, had their Thanksgiving feast in 1621 with the Wampanoag Native Americans.\n This 3-day feast is considered the ”first” Thanksgiving celebration in the colonies. However, there were other recorded ceremonies of thanks on these lands. In 1565, Spanish explorers and the local Timucua people of St. Augustine, Florida, celebrated a mass of thanksgiving. In 1619, British settlers proclaimed a day of thanksgiving when they reached a site known as Berkeley Hundred on the banks of Virginia’s James River.", "date": "5 days ago"}, {"doc_id": "d9", "title": "Why is Thanksgiving so late this year?

(There are also no Cracker Barrels in Washington, D.C., or any U.S. territories such as Puerto Rico.) Twenty more states have five or fewer Cracker Barrel locations.\n Location-Specific Décor\nAs you look for Cracker Barrels along your travel route, it is interesting to note that each of the chain’s 665 locations is decorated with authentic American artifacts. Reproductions are strictly forbidden. Not only that, but each location’s décor is unique. The company’s décor team chooses items that reflect the history and culture of the area where the restaurant is located, meaning the décor in the Bakersfield, California Cracker Barrel will be quite different from that of the store in Wilkes Barre, Pennsylvania. In this way, each restaurant also becomes a local museum of sorts. It’s one more pretty neat reason to seek out a Cracker Barrel while traveling.\n While many of these antiques are unique to a store’s specific area, there are a few items that are universal. Every Cracker Barrel location features a traffic light over the restrooms, an ox yoke and a horseshoe hanging over the front door, an antique cookstove (usually found in the retail area), a taxidermy deer head hanging above a wood-burning fireplace, and a barrel with a checkerboard in front of that fireplace.\n Cracker Barrel has a décor warehouse in Tennessee that is filled with around 90,000 pieces awaiting their permanent home in a future store.", "date": "2023-11-23 00:00:00"}]}

However, there is a significant difference between male and female billionaires: whereas most of the former were “self-made”, close to 40 percent of the latter had inherited their fortune. Furthermore, when looking at the demographics of billionaires globally, only 13 percent were women. Finally, only about 10 percent of the billionaires worldwide were younger than 50 years old. As of March 2025, 20-year-old Clemente Del Vecchio was the world's youngest billionaire.\n While this is not necessarily the industry from which the billionaires earn their fortune, nearly one-fourth of the world's male billionaires devote most of their time to banking and financing. On the other hand, the first industry among female billionaires was non-profit and social organizations. Concerning asset allocation; almost 40 percent of the wealth of male billionaires is derived from public holdings, while the same was the case for only 22 percent of female billionaires.\n The “self-made” billionaire myth\nThe common narrative about “self-made” is that in opposition to billionaires who inherited their fortune, “self-made” billionaires came from nothing and earned their wealth by themselves, working harder than others. However, this narrative fails to take into consideration systemic inequalities. Indeed, most of today's billionaires benefited from their family wealth, privilege, and social connections to start their businesses. And then, their businesses were largely supported by labor exploitation, tax loopholes, and government subsidies.\n This text provides general information.

The slab was eventually made spreadable, and the first jar of Nutella left the factory on April 20, 1964. The rest, they say, is history.\n Today, Nutella is the subject of food fandom and worldwide devotion—my own household included. Found on anything from polenta pancakes to—yep—pizza, the spread seemingly knows no limits. Statistically and financially, it's also a marvel: In 2013, you could reportedly circle the globe 1.4 times with the amount of Nutella produced; and in the beginning of 2015, one jar of Nutella was sold, worldwide, every 2.5 seconds. To make the spread comprising sugar, palm oil, hazelnut, cocoa solids, and skimmed milk, the Ferrero Group uses approximately 25 percent of the global supply of hazelnuts.\n And though the world has no shortage of idiosyncratic \"holidays,\" World Nutella Day is actually a real thing. Founded by American blogger Sara Rosso on February 5, 2007, the celebration is now managed by Ferrero and has become a global phenomenon. Want to celebrate the big day?

As with Napoleon's blockade, the onset of the war brought with it food rations, and the supply of cocoa was once again drastically limited. In 1946, Piedmontese pastry chef Pietro Ferrero, inspired by gianduiotti and his chocolatier forefathers, created a thick paste using hazelnuts, sugar, and what little cocoa was available. He shaped the paste into a loaf and named it \"Giandujot.\" But though its low proportion of expensive cocoa arose out of the cost-consciousness of the war years, Giandujot, so dense and thick that it had to be cut with a knife, was still too pricey for a mass audience.\n In 1951, Ferrero revolutionized the industry with the first spreadable version of his sweet loaf: \"La Supercrema.\" According to a BBC interview with Ferrero's grandson, Giovanni Ferrero, the spreadability of La Supercrema meant that \"a small amount went a very long way, helping to break down the perception that chocolate was, as Giovanni puts it, 'only for very special occasions and celebrations like Christmas and Easter.' \"\nThe availability and affordability of La Supercrema turned the chocolate-hazelnut spread into a household staple throughout Italy. In 1961, Ferrero's son, Michele, once again adjusted the recipe, adding palm oil and scaling it up for mass production. The new spread was rebranded as Nutella, and went on to become a common breakfast and snack item throughout Europe, touching down first in Asia and then the United States in the early 1980s.

Ever since its origin in the 60s, it's been a hugely successful product - a simple search of \"nutella recipes\" will garner you nearly 25-million results! However, we can't talk about how Nutella came to be without first talking about its tasty (and lesser known) predecessor: gianduja. Without the creation of gianduja, Nutella would have never existed (could you even imagine such a world?)\nGianduja has an interesting origin story, and it was serendipitously created out of ingredient limitations. It first came about in Turin, Piemonte (the chocolate capitol of Italy!) in the early 1800s, when Napoleon blocked all French allies - including Italy - from all trading of goods with the British. The restriction of British supplies included cocoa, and this limitation forced chocolatiers to get a bit creative to stretch their supply. The chocolatiers turned to an ingredient they had in abundance: plentiful hazelnuts from the Langhe mountains, just south of Turin. The chocolate masters created a spread of roughly 70% cocoa and 30% hazelnut paste - and thus, gianduja was born! This also led to the creation of gianduitto - individually-wrapped cocoa hazelnut confections that Turin is now famous for. Fast forward to the 1950s, when World War II left Italy in yet another short supply of chocolate. Chocolatier Pietro Ferrero is credited for adding cocoa butter to the gianduja mixture, which gave it a velvety, creamy consistency. In 1964, the first jar of Nutella was released - and the rest is history.

It's hard to imagine the brand's small plastic jars and brightly colored-labels outside of a modern grocery store or breakfast table, but this beloved chocolate-hazelnut spread has a long and fascinating history.\n One of the things you likely didn't know about Nutella is that it was invented in Piedmont, Italy as a solution to wartime food rationing, just after the end of World War II. In 1946, as the availability of cocoa in Europe dwindled, pastry chef Pietro Ferrero created his own chocolate-hazelnut paste product, which he called Giandujot. This paste stretched out smaller quantities of expensive cocoa by combining it with nuts and sugar. It was later tweaked to become a spread called La Supercrema, and by 1961, it went through another adaptation and was first sold under the brand name Nutella.\n However, the concept of Ferrero's chocolate-hazelnut paste long predates World War II, with similar products being made in the same region as far back as the early 1800s. The story of Italy's love for hazelnut paste begins before the country was even united as Italy, which happened in 1861.\n Nutella's Italian origins\nGcapture/Getty Images\nIf you know a little bit about Italian history, it makes perfect sense that Ferrero created Nutella in the Piedmont region.", "date": "Dec 14, 2023"}]}

This may be because this unrehearsed recording session from 1959 marks a great turning point in jazz history as well as showcasing the top form of some legendary musicians. Miles showed up to the Columbia recording studio with some rough melodies and chords jotted down on paper and the band proceeded to track each song in one or two takes. That's how Miles liked to do it, he made sure the music was spontaneous and in the moment. This album also marked a departure from the traditional bebop style with songs that are simple melodies over simple chord progressions leaving room for deep improvisational exploration. What a treat it is to listen to time and time again.\n A Love Supreme - John Coltrane\nThis album completely revolutionized the jazz scene in 1965 and even today its influence can be found in many musical styles. Instead of showcasing the complex and dense harmonic language in a post-bop style developed with Miles Davis and Thelonious Monk, Coltrane blows over simpler chords freely with a raw spiritual passion. The four songs on this album convey emotions of anger, joy, sadness, ecstasy, tragedy, and triumph. Many types of artists, such as writers or painters, use this album to inspire energy and passion from within themselves for their art. This album also marked a turning point in Coltrane's playing as he ventured into performing music from its deepest, most spiritual roots rather than from his prior more technical perspective.\n Time Out - Dave Brubeck\nDave Brubeck created a masterpiece that became the first instrumental jazz album to sell over a million copies.

Out of the thousands of jazz albums ever recorded, why does \"Kind of Blue\" maintain its hold on our imaginations more than any other? The simplest response is to say, because it's beautiful. You won't find many recordings that boast more thoughtful compositions or performances of any higher caliber than the solos and ensemble work of Davis, John Coltrane, Cannonball Adderley, Bill Evans, Wynton Kelly, Paul Chambers and Jimmy Cobb. The music has no weak spots. Or perhaps it's the unthreatening nature of the music: five medium-tempo selections, all played at the level of human conversation. There's nothing in these songs that would scare anyone. On the other hand, there are none of the signposts or road maps that make jazz accessible to listeners—no standards that you can hum, no vocals. And yet, even when you hear this album for the first time, it's like meeting an old friend. It sounds familiar somehow. Even today, at 50, \"Kind of Blue\" sounds, as Quincy Jones puts it, \"like it was made yesterday. \"\n Old yet new, strange but familiar—how can music possess such contrary qualities and still sound coherent? In the case of this album, it's because the music was designed that way. It coheres because it was conceived as a whole. Each cut contributes to the whole (in this sense, it might better be titled \"Kinds of Blue\"). One of the most important elements built in from the start was an open-ended sense of discovery and exploration.

That said, season 5 sets up Prison Break season 6, with Michael being offered a government job to make use of his unique skills. Star Wentworth Miller also revealed that same year he pitched an endearingly silly season 6 idea where the brothers are locked up by their psychotic, previously unrevealed brother Tag, and they'd have to relive their past escapes in a new prison.\n Series creator Paul Scheuring, on the other hand, appears content that Prison Break season 5 ending is definitive. Fox's most recent statement on the series' future in August 2019 confirms Scheuring's sentiments, with the network stating that there are no current plans to revive Prison Break to date.", "date": "NA"}]}

Anthony Beevor, author of Arnhem: The Battle for the Bridges, 1944, said in 2021 that “Market Garden was a very bad plan, right from the start.”\n Elsewhere, historians like James Holland and Al Murray on their podcast We Have Ways of Making You Talk, posit that General Gavin’s decision to hold his American soldiers on the southside of Nijmegen bridge as having significant negative effects on XXX Corp’s advance.\n Others take a different approach.

The operation was an ambitious plan by the Allied forces to capture several key bridges in the Netherlands to create a direct route into Germany and end the war quickly. However, the operation was ultimately unsuccessful, and the proverb “A bridge too far” has come to represent a situation where a goal or objective is overly ambitious, beyond what is realistically achievable, or too difficult to attain. The key points of the proverb “A bridge too far” include:\nAmbition: The proverb reflects the idea of setting overly ambitious goals or objectives that may be difficult or impossible to achieve. It suggests that attempting to reach for something that is too far beyond one’s capabilities or resources may result in failure.\n Realism: The proverb highlights the importance of being realistic and pragmatic in setting goals and expectations. It implies that it is essential to assess the feasibility and attainability of a goal before pursuing it, to avoid reaching for something that is unattainable or unrealistic.\nRisk-taking: The proverb also suggests that taking on risks that are too high or attempting to achieve something that is beyond reasonable risk levels may result in failure or negative consequences. It emphasizes the need to carefully consider risks and benefits in any endeavor.\n Consequences of Overreach: The proverb implies that overextending oneself or a situation beyond reasonable limits may lead to negative outcomes or adverse consequences. It warns against pushing too hard or going too far beyond one’s capabilities or resources, as it may result in failure, setback, or disappointment.\n Lessons from History: The proverb “A bridge too far” originated from the historical context of Operation Market Garden, which serves as a reminder of the risks and challenges of over-ambition and unrealistic goals. It highlights the importance of learning from past mistakes and being mindful of historical lessons when setting goals or pursuing endeavors.", "date": "2025-01-13"}, {"doc_id": "d8", "title": "The statement \"a bridge too far\" was made before the Battle of Arnhem", "url": "https://www.battle-of-arnhem.com/the-statement-a-bridge-too-far-was-made-before-the-battle-of-arnhem/", "snippet": "The statement “a bridge too far” was made before the Battle of Arnhem\nWhoever says “Battle of Arnhem” says “a bridge too far”. The phrase is the title of the book that Cornelis Ryan wrote in 1974 about Operation Market Garden, and it is also the title of the film made by Richard Attenborough in 1977 in response to the book.\n Browning\nMany people think that the expression that Arnhem was “a bridge too far” is the conclusion that was drawn after the Battle of Arnhem. However, that is not true.\n The statement was made a few days before the start of Operation Market Garden by British General Frederick “Boy” Browning. Browning was the commander of the British 1st Airborne Corps. The 1st Airborne Division led by General Urquhart and the Polish Parachute Brigade led by General Sosabowski were part of it.\n The 1st Airborne Division was established by Browning in 1942. It was Browning who invented the maroon-colored berets for the paratroopers. He also had the famous Pegasus logo designed.\n When Browning was informed by the planners of Montgomery about the plans for “his” paratroopers near Arnhem, he was told that the British had to occupy the bridges at Arnhem for two days before they were relieved by the ground troops.\n Browning replied that the paratroopers could last four days. He later admitted to commander Roy Urquhart of the 1st Airborne Division that he had added, “But I think we might be going a bridge too far.”\n The statement was recorded in 1973 by Cornelis Ryan when writing his book about Market Garden, after which the statement took on a life of its own.\n So General Browning was skeptical about the plans with his airborne division. At the same time, he dismissed the (retrospective) criticism that was made of the plans.\n He waved away warnings that German armored units had been seen near Arnhem. He denied that the distance between the landing areas and the bridges over the Rhine would be too far.", "date": "2020-05-23"}, {"doc_id": "d9", "title": "\"A Bridge Too Far\" Meaning, Origin and Examples - 7ESL", "url": "https://7esl.com/a-bridge-too-far/", "snippet": "A bridge too far is a common idiom used within the English language, but for many people its meaning can be confusing.

It signifies a situation where someone has overreached in their goals or aspirations, often leading to failure or a significant setback.\n Examples:\n“His plan to complete the project in a week was a bridge too far; we need more time to do it properly.”\n “Attempting to expand the business internationally without proper research was a bridge too far.”\nOrigin of This Idiomatic Expression\nThe phrase comes from the title of the book and film “A Bridge Too Far,” which recounts Operation Market Garden during World War II, an Allied military operation aimed at capturing key bridges in the Netherlands to facilitate a swift advance into Germany. The operation ultimately failed, as the Allies attempted to capture a bridge at Arnhem, which proved to be “too far” beyond their reach.\n Usage of “A Bridge Too Far”\n In a business context:\n“The proposal to expand into three new markets at once was a bridge too far for the management team.”\n Talking about personal goals:\n“While I appreciate his enthusiasm, trying to run a marathon without proper training was definitely a bridge too far.”\n In a discussion about project planning:\n“The idea of completing the project in just one month is a bridge too far, given the resources we have.”", "date": "2024-10-15 00:00:00"}, {"doc_id": "d10", "title": "For Trump supporters, 'a bridge too far' must be nearby", "url": "https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/2023/06/13/for-trump-supporters-a-bridge-too-far-must-be-nearby/", "snippet": "For Trump supporters, ‘a bridge too far’ must be nearby\nJune 13, 2023 7:00 am\nI often wonder where idioms like “a bridge too far” originate. This phrase comes from the title of the 1974 book of the same name, by Cornelius Ryan. The book tells the story of Operation Market Garden, the Allies’ plan of attack to conquer several bridges in the Netherlands in September of 1944. The goal was to establish a route over the Rhine River for an invasion into Germany.\n The Allies never captured that last bridge at Arnhem, and the mission ultimately failed.\n For Americans who possess apparently unrelenting fealty to former President Donald Trump, the bridges in front of them are also numerous. Trump’s influence, his top position in Republican party politics, relies on a constituency that will seemingly follow him anywhere.\n Trump famously said in January of 2016, “I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, and I wouldn’t lose any voters, OK?”\n In June of 2023, the zombies who support him would apparently applaud such a thing. What would the cadre of elected officials, who desperately want this crowd of voters to see them synonymously with the indicted former president, do? They might claim the NYPD is simply an arm of the evil Democratic Party, or even the sinister Biden campaign, and that arresting their dear leader for murder is merely a political stunt.\n Need to get in touch?\n Have a news tip?\n It sounds ridiculous, but it isn’t. The federal indictment that was released last week, and the arraignment scheduled for Tuesday afternoon, challenges the seriousness of murder. What!? How could an editorial writer write something so offensive? Trump just “mishandled” some paper! All politicians do it!\n First of all, no they don’t. No American, a politician or otherwise, has ever done what Donald Trump is accused of here. He took sensitive, classified, dangerous documents from the White House that he was not authorized to take. That actually does happen with alarming regularity.", "date": "2023-06-13 00:00:00"}]}

Enver Pasha, one of the most influential members of the Ottoman government, maintained an optimistic stance, hid information that made the Ottoman position appear weak, and led most of the Ottoman elite to believe that the war was still winnable.[2]\nGrand Vizier Talaat Pasha visited Berlin, Germany, and Sofia, Bulgaria in September 1918. He came away with the understanding that the war was no longer winnable. With Germany likely seeking a separate peace, the Ottomans would be forced to do so as well. Talaat convinced the other members of the ruling party that they must resign, as the Allies would impose far harsher terms if they thought the people who started the war were still in power. He also sought out the United States to see if he could surrender to them and gain the benefits of the Fourteen Points despite the Ottoman Empire and the United States not being at war; however, the Americans never responded, as they were waiting on British advice as to how to respond that never came. On October 13, Talaat and the rest of his ministry resigned. Ahmed Izzet Pasha replaced Talaat as Grand Vizier. Two days after taking office, he sent the captured British General Charles Vere Ferrers Townshend to the Allies to seek terms on an armistice.

The Turks fought fiercely and successfully defended the Gallipoli Peninsula against a massive Allied invasion in 1915-1916, but by 1918 defeat by invading British and Russian forces and an Arab revolt had combined to destroy the Ottoman economy and devastate its land, leaving some six million people dead and millions more starving.\nWorld War I: Global Connections\nAs early as the first week of October 1918, both the Ottoman government and several individual Turkish leaders contacted the Allies to feel out peace possibilities. Britain, whose forces then occupied much of the Ottoman territories, was loath to step aside for its allies, particularly France, which according to an agreement concluded in 1916 would take control of the Syrian coast and much of modern-day Lebanon. In a move that enraged his French counterpart, Georges Clemenceau, Prime Minister David Lloyd George and his cabinet authorized Admiral Arthur Calthorpe, Britain’s naval commander in the Aegean Sea, to negotiate an immediate armistice with Turkey without consulting France. Though Britain alone would engineer the Ottoman exit from the war, the two powerful Allies would continue to grapple over control in the region at the Paris Peace Conference, and for years beyond.\n Negotiations between Calthorpe’s team and the delegation from Constantinople, led by the Ottoman Minister of Marine Affairs Rauf Bey, began at 9:30 on the morning of October 30, 1918, aboard the Agamemnon.", "date": "Nov 5, 2009"}, {"doc_id": "d3", "title": "Collapse of the Ottoman Empire, 1918-1920 - | NZ History", "url": "https://nzhistory.govt.nz/war/ottoman-empire/collapse", "snippet": "The Ottoman Empire\nPage 9 – Collapse of the Ottoman Empire, 1918-1920\n The armistice of 31 October 1918 ended the fighting between the Ottoman Empire and the Allies but did not bring stability or peace to the region. The British were in control of Syria, Palestine and Mesopotamia (Iraq), and British, French and Greek forces stood ready to march across the Bulgarian border and occupy Ottoman Thrace and Constantinople. The Sultan, Mehmed VI, feared he would be deposed. The Allies, however, knew he was a figurehead and hoped that his retention would help ensure post-war stability.\n Stability was badly needed. The Young Turk government led by Enver Pasha had collapsed in the days leading up to the armistice. Enver, Cemal Pasha and Talât Pasha had all fled the country to seek sanctuary in Germany. Across what was left of the empire civil infrastructure, already badly strained by years of war, began to disintegrate. Law and order broke down completely in many places. Simmering ethnic and religious tensions erupted into violence and large numbers of deserters turned to banditry and roamed the countryside. The Allies marched into Constantinople with the intention of taking control of large areas of Anatolia. Their pretext was the restoration of order, but this plan also reflected the terms of the peace settlement they were drafting. It was clear that the post-war Ottoman state would not even cover all of Anatolia. This prospect horrified most Turks, for whom Anatolia was their heartland.\n In November 1919, there seemed to be little the interim Ottoman government could do to stop the Allies. The remnants of the two Ottoman armies destroyed by the final British offensive in Palestine and Syria were slowly reassembling under Mustafa Kemal’s command in Cilicia, north of Aleppo. In Mesopotamia the battered but still intact Ottoman Sixth Army regrouped north of Mosul and awaited orders.", "date": "Jan 13, 2016"}, {"doc_id": "d4", "title": "Milestones to peace: the Armistice of Mudros", "url": "https://blog.nationalarchives.gov.uk/milestones-peace-armistice-mudros/", "snippet": "The armistice was signed on board HMS Agamemnon at Port Mudros, on the island of Lemnos, on 30 October 1918.

Catalogue reference FO 93/110/80\nThe entry of the Ottoman Empire into the war on the side of the Central Powers in November 1914 had greatly extended the geographical scope of the conflict. As well as Anatolia – the area containing what is now Turkey – theatres of war sprang up in North Africa, across the Levant and the Middle East, and in Transcaucasia. This, crucially, cut off trade into the Black Sea: a vital artery for Russia.\n Attempts to knock Turkey out of the war early in 1915 failed. This would have involved taking the Dardanelles straits and the Gallipoli peninsula, providing a quick route to the Turkish capital of Constantinople.\n On the Russian front, in April 1915 the Armenian population of the eastern city of Van rose up against the Ottomans in response to growing violence from the Turkish majority. The Armenians seized the city but were soon besieged. Bitter fighting continued in the area for much of 1915. This led to the forced deportation of virtually the entire Armenian community in eastern Anatolia. The deportation was accompanied by widespread robbery and murder, and culminated in forced marches across the Syrian desert. This policy resulted in death on an extraordinary scale (FO 371/2488).\n The campaigns in North Africa, the Arabian peninsula and the Persian Gulf were largely concluded by the end of 1917.

In October of that year, an armistice between the Ottoman Empire and the Allies ended fighting in the Middle East. Only days later, the disintegrating Austro-Hungarian Empire signed an armistice with Italy.\n “You bet we were happy yesterday morning to be awoken at 3 o’clock by whistles blowing, guns firing and every kind of noise you could think of announcing the surrender of Germany.

The Allied delegation, led by Supreme Allied Commander Marshal Ferdinand Foch, largely ignored United States President Woodrow Wilson’s Fourteen Points for Peace and left no room for negotiation. The German delegation was given 72 hours to accept the terms, which were purposefully severe to prevent Germany from resuming fighting. These included complete demilitarization, the evacuation of France, Belgium and Alsace-Lorraine (a territory that had been annexed by Germany in 1871 following the Franco-Prussian War), and the immediate release of Allied prisoners of war and interned civilians.\n “Dearest Mother and Dad: If only you all could see how glad everyone in this place is!

During Abdul Hamid II's reign, civilian communications had improved, but the road and rail network was not ready for war.[2] It took more than a month to reach Syria and nearly two months to reach Mesopotamia. To reach the border with Russia, the railway ran only 60 km east of Ankara, and from there, it was 35 days to Erzurum.[2] The Army used Trabzon port as a logistical shortcut to the east.

The oldest archaeological peach stones are from the Kuahuqiao site near Hangzhou. Archaeologists point to the Yangtze River Valley as the place where the early selection for favorable peach varieties probably took place.[54]\nA domesticated peach appeared very early in Japan, in 4700–4400 BCE, during the Jōmon period. It was already similar to modern cultivated forms, where the peach stones are significantly larger and more compressed than earlier stones. This domesticated type of peach was brought into Japan from China. Nevertheless, in China itself, this variety is currently attested only at a later date around 3300 to 2300 BCE.[55]\nIt is also found elsewhere in West Asia in ancient times.[57]", "date": "NA"}, {"doc_id": "d2", "title": "The History of Peaches | Frog Hollow Farm", "url": "https://www.froghollow.com/blogs/news/the-history-of-peaches-frog-hollow-farm-1?srsltid=AfmBOooyFNwz2r-OUQ5Ac6SDlzk4frH1FiIIjRL0dyipkwa7eoXf8qke", "snippet": "From the Farm Box Membership to reoccurring orders of Extra Virgin Olive Oil and Granola, we are happy to send you our items at a weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly delivery rate, whichever works best for you!

The information is vast, but I thought I'd share with you some tidbits about the history of everyone's favorite stone fruit- the PEACH.\n Peaches originated in China, where they are native to northwest China. Archaeologists believe that peaches in China were first domesticated along the Yangzi River, where they have found fossilized peach stones believed to be from 6000 BC. Historians have found peaches discussed in Chinese writings from the 10th century. Of specific importance to Chinese culture was the peach blossom, thought to fend off evil spirits and provide vitality. When traveling between towns, Emperors were preceded by soldiers carrying peach blossoms, and each New Year began with peach blossoms hung on front doors all over the county.\n To this day, China is the world's leading peach producer. China produces half of the world's peaches - 11 million tons of peaches per year, followed by Italy producing 1.5 tons, and then the USA at 1 ton.\n The botanical name for peach is \"Prunus persica\", translated from Latin to \"Present from Persia\", referring to the Persian introduction of the Peach to the Romans. After conquering Persia, Alexander the Great took peach seeds to Europe, marking the introduction of the fruits to Spain and France. In the 16th century, Spanish explorers brought the first peaches to South America; from there, the peach traveled to England, where it became a rare and prized delicacy. It was known that Queen Victoria's favorite treat was a fresh peach after dinner.", "date": "Apr 27, 2017"}, {"doc_id": "d3", "title": "Where did white peaches come from? - Quora", "url": "https://www.quora.com/Where-did-white-peaches-come-from", "snippet": "Peaches came originally from China and the white fleshed peaches are the most popular ones in China today but they have been around as long as ...", "date": "Jul 24, 2021"}, {"doc_id": "d4", "title": "Where Do the Best Peaches Come From? - Serious Eats", "url": "https://www.seriouseats.com/where-do-the-best-peaches-come", "snippet": "I have been on a lifelong search for the perfect peach, one that's so juicy you end up wearing it, one that has a perfect balance between sweetness and acidity. You might think that those of us who celebrate local food would pronounce the peach grown in our backyard the best, but I live in New York City, where there are precious few backyards. But I cannot say in good conscience and all honesty that the peaches grown in neighboring backyards and farms all over New Jersey, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania are the best, either. I certainly eat more than my fair share of local farmers' market peaches from Nemeth Orchards and Stone Arch Farms, but their peaches are not life-changing affairs.\n I have friends from Georgia who claim that the best peaches are grown there (yes, I know that baseball Hall of Famer Ty Cobb was nicknamed the Georgia Peach), but I have tasted many Georgia peaches, and though they can be pretty damn fine, they are not the best. Others say that the best peaches come from South Carolina or Texas or Colorado. They would be wrong as well.\n No, I'm afraid I can say with more than a modicum of certainty that the best peaches come from sunny California. Some would say they come from Frog Hollow in Brentwood, and farmer Al Corchesne grows a mighty fine peach. But the best peaches I have ever put in my mouth come from Goldbud Farms in Placerville, in the middle of California Gold Rush country, and from Honey Crisp Farms in Reedley, just outside Fresno.\n I recently found Honey Crisp peaches at a new farmstand on Martha's Vineyard, and at $6.98 a pound, they were a stone cold bargain. Goldbud's Ron Mansfield and Honey Crisp's Art Lange both have degrees in peachology from the University of California. They employ sophisticated growing and irrigation methods to grow peaches that will make you think you're tasting one for the first time.

At the beginning of the Georgia peach boom, one of Atlanta's major roads was renamed Peachtree Street. But despite its associations with perfectly pink-orange peaches, \"The Peach State\" of Georgia is neither the biggest peach producing state (that honor goes to California) nor are peaches its biggest crop.\n So why is it that Georgia peaches are so iconic? The answer, like so much of Southern history, has a lot to do with slavery — specifically, its end and a need for the South to rebrand itself. Yet, as historian William Thomas Okie writes in his book The Georgia Peach, the fruit may be sweet but the industry in the South was formed on the same culture of white supremacy as cotton and other slave-tended crops.\n Sponsor Message\nPeaches, which are native to Asia, have been growing haphazardly in the United States since they were brought over by Europeans in the 17th century. But it wasn't until the latter half of the 1800s that aspiring horticulturists began to try and grow the peach as an orchard crop. In 1856, a Belgian father-and-son pair, Louis and Prosper Berckmans, purchased a plot of orchard land in Augusta, Ga., that would come to be known as Fruitland. Their intention was to demonstrate that fruit and ornamental plants could become just as important an industry in the South as cotton, which was ruining the soil with its intensive planting.\n Buy Featured Book\nHorticulture slowly became accepted as a gentleman's pursuit. But it wasn't until the end of the Civil War and the abolishment of slavery that the sudden availability of labor gave peaches the perfect opening. After the war, \"fruit growing, which to the cotton planter was a secondary matter, [became] one of great solicitude to the farmer,\" Prosper Berckmans wrote in 1876.", "date": "Jul 21, 2017"}, {"doc_id": "d7", "title": "All About Peaches — Fishers Orchard", "url": "https://www.fishersorchard.com/about-peaches", "snippet": "All About Peaches\nFishers means peaches\nIt is said that the peach originated in China, but for many people in the Upstate, peaches mean Fishers. We’ve been growing peaches since 1930, so we know a thing or two about what it takes to produce a juicy, sweet, mouth-watering peach or nectarine.\n Fishers Orchard sells approximately 50 different peach varieties, as well as nectarines and plums, at its three Greer locations. Fresh peaches are generally available from June until September, but that can vary based on growing conditions.\n Did you know?\nSouth Carolina has a long, storied history with the peach. According to historical records, peaches were found in South Carolina as far back as the late 1600s. Since then, a lot has changed, but South Carolina.\n Today, South Carolina produces the most peaches of any state in the South. Our state ships about 90,000 tons a year compared with Georgia’s 40,000 tons, according to United States Department of Agriculture statistics. Nationwide, the top four states in peach production are California, South Carolina, Georgia and New Jersey. California is a significant producer of both fresh and processed peaches, while South Carolina and Georgia mainly produce fresh peaches.\n Other interesting facts:\nThere are about 18,000 acres of peach orchards in South Carolina.\n More than 200 million pounds of peaches are harvested in South Carolina in a typical year.\n South Carolina has been called “The tastier peach state.”\n Weather is the most important factor in growing peaches. A 1- or 2-degree drop at a critical time can make or break a peach crop.\n Peaches are rich sources of vitamins A and C as well as alpha hydroxy fruit acids.\n How to select the best peaches\nA key thing to remember is that Fishers Orchard peaches are picked at the peak of their sweetness, so they are ready to eat. They won’t become sweeter as they sit around and soften.

Only One Gene Separates Peaches and Nectarines\nAnother interesting peach fact is peaches and apricots are only separated by one gene. The mutation causes apricots to have smooth skin instead of peaches' distinct fuzzy texture.\n Nectarines sometimes appear to have a deeper red color than peaches, which is most likely due to the lack of fuzz that allows the color to come through more. Regardless, other than the one differing recessive gene, peaches and nectarines are genetically identical. Nectarines can even be found growing on the same tree as peaches.\n 4. Georgia Is Known as the \"Peach State\"\nWhen you think of Georgia, you may also think of peaches. But do you know why?\nWhile other states, such as California and South Carolina, also grow peaches, Georgia produces the most high-quality and delicious peaches. Georgia's location and weather provide optimal peach growing conditions by being far north enough to provide enough winter chill but south enough to ensure harvesting can happen on schedule. Peaches are now recognized as the state fruit of Georgia.\n 5. Peaches Originated in China\nA lesser-known fun fact about peaches is they are one of the most ancient domesticated fruits, with theirorigins leading back to China. Peaches are considered very important in Chinese culture as they symbolize fertility and longevity, and the fruit is mentioned throughout Chinese mythology.\n Peach seeds are easy to preserve and transport, which made them a popular item for trading along the Silk Road. Eventually, peaches made their way to America once Spanish conquistadors introduced peaches to North America during the mid-1500s. Peach trees quickly sprouted in Virginia, Georgia and the Carolinas.\n6. There Are Three Categories of Peaches\nPeaches are considered a stone fruit because of the hard pit located in the peach's center. The stone or pit and its relationship to the sweet fruity flesh surrounding it determine how peaches are categorized.", "date": "Mar 15, 2023"}, {"doc_id": "d9", "title": "Peach | Fruit, Description, History, Cultivation, Uses, & Facts", "url": "https://www.britannica.com/plant/peach", "snippet": "The peach fruit develops from a single ovary that ripens into both a fleshy juicy exterior that forms the edible part of the fruit and a hard interior, called the stone or pit, that encloses the seed(s). Of the two ovules in the ovary, usually only one becomes fertilized and develops into a seed. This frequently results in one half of the fruit being slightly larger than the other. The flesh may be white, yellow, or red. Varieties may be freestone types, which have stones that separate easily from the ripe flesh, or clingstones, which have flesh that adheres firmly to the stone. The skin of most ripe peaches is downy or fuzzy; peaches with smooth skins are called nectarines. Most peach varieties produce more fruits than can be maintained and developed to full size. Some shedding of fruitlets takes place naturally, about a month to six weeks after full bloom, but the number remaining may have to be reduced further by hand thinning.\n History and cultivation\nThe peach probably originated in China and then spread westward through Asia to the Mediterranean countries and later to other parts of Europe. The Spanish explorers took the peach to the New World, and as early as 1600 the fruit was found in Mexico. For centuries the cultivation and selection of new varieties of peaches were largely confined to the gardens of the nobility, and large-scale commercial peach growing did not begin until the 19th century, in the United States. The early plantings were seedling peaches, inevitably variable and often of poor quality. The practice of grafting superior strains onto hardy seedling rootstocks, which came later in the century, led to the development of large commercial orchards. Worldwide, the peach is one of the most important deciduous-tree fruits, and China, Italy, Spain, and the United States are major producers.\n Peach trees are relatively short-lived as compared with some other fruit trees.", "date": "Jan 3, 2025"}]}
