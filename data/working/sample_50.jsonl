Following the death of the previous sultan, Zanzibari Prince Khālid ibn Barghash refused to accept the British Empire’s preferred successor and instead occupied the sultan’s palace, which prompted imperial cruisers to fire on his position. The war lasted no longer than 40 minutes, making it the shortest war in recorded history.\n Context\nIn the late 19th century, Britain’s extended its influence over East Africa in general and Zanzibar in particular. While SayyidSaʿīd ibn Sulṭān had expanded Zanzibar’s regional holdings and global mercantile importance in the first half the century, his successor Barghash was forced to bend to European powers and partition his land among the British and the Germans; later sultans followed suit. By 1890 Britain had convinced the sultanate to cede its mainland territories to Germany while allowing the island itself to become a protectorate of the British Empire. Britain agreed to preserve the sultanate as an institution, but it stressed that the power of the sultan was nominal.\n What was the shortest war in history? An episode of Breaking Bad has a longer run time than the Anglo-Zanzibar War.\n Upon becoming Zanzibar’s protector, Britain outlined two key policy goals: the abolition of slavery and the restoration of the island’s strong mercantile economy. Consul General Gerald Portal’s economic policy angered the Zanzibari merchants, but what angered them more was the policy on slavery, which had become integral to their way of life as spice plantations surged in value throughout the 19th century. Sayyid Ali ibn Saʿīd resisted Britain’s directives until his death in 1893, and, when it came time to choose his successor, Britain voiced its expectation that the next sultan be more submissive to imperial authority. Out of the several claimants to the throne, the British backed Ḥamad ibn Thuwayn.", "date": "2019-09-17"}, {"doc_id": "d2", "title": "Holy cow! history: Ready, set, surrender!

It lasted less than 40 minutes.\n The East African island of Zanzibar had come under the control of the British Empire just a few years before. Britain had two goals for its new protectorate: abolish slavery there and fix the economy.\n Britain had agreed to keep the existing sultanate in place, but the sultan’s power was diminished by Zanzibar’s treaty with Britain.\n British officials soon found some sultans to be more receptive toward their agenda than others. During the 1890s the British government tried to install a ruler who would support abolition: a tough ask in Zanzibar, where the economy was built on the spice trade and ending slavery meant earning the ire of many of the richest members of the population.\n Ḥamad ibn Thuwayn was made sultan in 1893. Ḥamad was seen as a puppet of the British Empire. He ruled peacefully until his death in 1896. Speculation persists that his sudden death may have been murder on the part of his nephew, Prince Khālid ibn Barghash.\n After Ḥamad’s untimely demise, Prince Khālid—who had been passed over as sultan twice already—claimed the palace (and its harem). He assembled an army of more than 2,800 men, artillery, and an armed yacht.\n The British warned Khālid that they would take military action if he did not vacate the palace by 9:00 AM on August 27th.\n Prince Khālid defied the order. British warships opened fire at 9:00 AM as promised. Within two minutes the majority of Khālid’s artillery was destroyed.\n The forces of the prince fought on for nearly 40 more minutes: they suffered 500 casualties by the time the onslaught halted.", "date": "Aug 5, 2024"}, {"doc_id": "d4", "title": "How Long Was The 1896 Anglo-Zanzibar War? - HistoryExtra", "url": "https://www.historyextra.com/period/victorian/shortest-war-history/", "snippet": "The Anglo-Zanzibar War of 1896 will never be considered one of the world’s significant conflicts; it wasn’t even the biggest for the British during that decade, with the Second Boer War coming a few years later. But it does hold a distinct honour: it is the shortest war ever recorded in history.\n Advertisement\nWhy is the Anglo-Zanzibar War the shortest war in history?\n Fought on 27 August 1896 between the British empire and the Sultanate of Zanzibar, the whole thing lasted around 38 minutes.\n It ended with a complete victory for the British, who cemented their position in Zanzibar for decades to come. The war’s brevity, however, belied the complex geopolitics that led to its outbreak in the first place.\n What was the background to the Anglo-Zanzibar War?\nZanzibar, an archipelago off the East African coast of modern-day Tanzania, was a strategic hub in the Indian Ocean, rich in resources and a crossroads for trade routes. By 1890, it had become a British protectorate, meaning that while the sultan remained a figurehead it was the British empire that wielded political and military control.\n Britain’s interests in Zanzibar were primarily driven by trade concerns, which had to be placed in the wider context of imperialist competition with other European colonial powers in Africa, notably the German empire. The islands had proven to be crucial for controlling shipping lanes from British India to Europe.\n Moreover, the British had launched a campaign to suppress the East African slave trade, motivated by both humanitarian and imperialist purposes, and Zanzibar had long been a major trafficking centre.\n What caused the Anglo-Zanzibar War to break out?\n The catalyst for the war was the death of the pro-British sultan, Hamad bin Thuwaini, in August 1896. While not confirmed, he was almost certainly poisoned by his cousin, Khālid ibn Barghash, who then hastily declared himself the new sultan.", "date": "Nov 26, 2024"}, {"doc_id": "d5", "title": "The shortest war in history: The Anglo-Zanzibar War of 1896", "url": "https://www.history.org.uk/publications/resource/7950/the-shortest-war-in-history-the-anglo-zanzibar-wa", "snippet": "The shortest war in history: The Anglo-Zanzibar War of 1896\nAt 9am on 27 August 1896, following an ultimatum, five ships of the Royal Navy began a bombardment of the Royal Palace and Harem in Zanzibar.

Over 500 defenders died, compared to one British marine who was injured. Thus ended what is widely regarded as the ‘shortest war in history.'\n The immediate cause of the war was the death of the Sultan of Zanzibar, Hamad bin Thuwaini on the 25 August. His nephew, Khalid bin Bargash, seized power, but he was regarded by the British as far too independent. They preferred Hamud bin Muhammed. In the best tradition of gunboat diplomacy, an ultimatum was issued at 8am, giving Khalid an hour to surrender and leave the palace. When the ultimatum expired the bombardment began, and a force of marines was landed on the shore. As the shells landed, Khalid bin Bargash fled the palace seeking safety in the German consulate, from which he was quickly and in secret shipped out of the country. Order was restored and Britain's preferred ruler Hamud bin Muhammed was installed as Sultan of Zanzibar where he ruled, with British assistance, until his death in 1902.

Neighbouring areas have Jain temples known as basadis and several images of the Tirthankaras. Vindyagiri Hill is one of the two hills in Shravanabelagola.

The first prize in 1901 was reported in hundreds of newspapers in different parts of the world.[48] The prizes to Rudyard Kipling in 1907 and Rabindranath Tagore in 1913 helped to establish the prize as a central phenomenon in world literature. After the second world war the prize has earned more intense media attention with dramatic news reports and in-depth comments from around the world, further establishing its central position in the world literature space.[48] Days before the announcement of the year's nobel laurete in literature possible winners are widely guessed in the media, and controversial and surprise choices has often caused much media discussion.[48]\nCriticism\nAlthough the Nobel Prize in Literature has become the world's most prestigious literature prize,[49] the Swedish Academy has attracted significant criticism for its handling of the award. Many authors who have won the prize have fallen into obscurity, while others rejected by the jury remain widely studied and read. In the Wall Street Journal, Joseph Epstein wrote, \"You might not know it, but you and I are members of a club whose fellow members include Leo Tolstoy, Henry James, Anton Chekhov, Mark Twain, Henrik Ibsen, Marcel Proust, James Joyce, Jorge Luis Borges and Vladimir Nabokov. The club is the Non-Winners of the Nobel Prize in Literature. All these authentically great writers, still alive when the prize, initiated in 1901, was being awarded, didn't win it. \"[50] Other notable names from the non-western canon who were ignored despite being nominated several times for the prize include Sri Aurobindo and Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan.

Likewise, his cosmopolitan aspirations made him an advocate of peace and of the brotherhood of nations. In his will he also included literature, although he placed it after the sciences, to which he felt most drawn.\n Literature is grateful to him that its practitioners have also been the object of his solicitude; one could argue that it comes last in the group of Swedish prizes for the very sound reason that the supreme flower of civilization, perhaps most beautiful yet also most delicate, will now bloom on the firm ground of reality.\n In any event, the laureates receive in these floral tributes of modern times a recompense surpassing in material value the golden violets of a past era.\n The award of the Nobel Prize in Literature poses its own problems. «Literature» is a very inclusive term and the statutes of the Nobel Foundation rightly specify that the competition must include not only belles-lettres but also works which, by their form as well as by their exposition, have literary value. But thereby the field is expanded and the difficulties are compounded. If it is difficult to decide – supposing that the merits of the proposed authors otherwise are approximately equal – whether the Prize should be granted to a lyric, an epic, or a dramatic poet, the task is complicated even more if it becomes a matter of choosing among an eminent historian, a great philosopher, and a poet of genius. The dimensions become, as the mathematicians say, incommensurable. But one may be consoled with the thought that, since the Prize is an annual one, more than one writer of merit who has to yield his place to another equally great, may be able to receive some other year the award he deserves.\n Numerous and excellent recommendations for the literary Prize have reached the Swedish Academy.", "date": "2025-04-03"}, {"doc_id": "d3", "title": "All Nobel Prizes in Literature - NobelPrize.org", "url": "https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/lists/all-nobel-prizes-in-literature/", "snippet": "The Nobel Prize in Literature has been awarded 117 times to 121 Nobel Prize laureates between 1901 and 2024.

Around that time, one of Nobel’s brothers died in France, and French newspapers printed obituaries in which they mistook him for Alfred. One headline read, “The merchant of death is dead.” Alfred Nobel in fact had pacifist tendencies and in his later years apparently developed strong misgivings about the impact of his inventions on the world. After he died in San Remo, Italy, on December 10, 1896, the majority of his estate went toward the creation of prizes to be given annually in the fields of physics, chemistry, medicine, literature, and peace. The portion of his will establishing the Nobel Peace Prize read, “[one award shall be given] to the person who has done the most or best work for fraternity among nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies, and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses.” Exactly five years after his death, the first Nobel awards were presented.\n Today, the Nobel Prizes are regarded as the most prestigious awards in the world in their various fields.

On that day, Folke Henschen told radio listeners his personal memories of the very first Nobel Prize awards, which he experienced as a student marshal. What follows here is a more detailed version.\n After long protracted negotiations, partly with the French government (which sought to impose a very hefty tax on the Nobel estate) and partly with the Nobel family, the first awarding of five Nobel Prizes could finally take place on 10 December 1901 – four of them given out in Stockholm and one, the Peace Prize, in Christiania, as Oslo was then called. Five years had passed since Alfred Nobel had died in San Remo, on 10 December 1896.\n In the days leading up to the awarding of prizes, there was certain tension in the air. The Nobel Laureates’ names had been kept secret – they were not, as now, revealed months in advance. When three distinguished German – speaking gentlemen arrived by train from the south and were taken to the Grand Hotel, it was clear that they must be the Nobel Laureates.

In his last will Nobel declared that the whole of his remaining fortune of 31, 5 million Swedish crowns was to be invested in safe securities and should constitute a fund \"the interest on which shall be annually distributed in the form of prizes to those who, during the preceding year, shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind\"\nWill\nThe will specified in which fields the prizes should be awarded – physics, chemistry, medicine or physiology, literature and peace – and which criteria the respective prize committees should apply when choosing their prize recipients. According to the will the Nobel Peace Prize was to be awarded “to the person who shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between the nations and the abolition or reduction of standing armies and the formation and spreading of peace congresses.”\nNorwegian Nobel Committee\nAlfred Nobel’s will declared that the Nobel Peace Prize was to be awarded by a committee of five persons selected by the Norwegian Storting (parliament). The Storting accepted the assignment in April 1897, and the Nobel Committee of the Norwegian Storting was set up in August of the same year.

Wiman said the prize could just as easily go to a Mexican or Argentinian writer as an African author. “I think it will be a woman from a language zone outside Europe,” he said.\n His personal pick would however be British Indian-born author Salman Rushdie—a symbol of free speech after receiving death threats over his 1988 novel The Satanic Verses which was declared blasphemous by Iran’s Supreme Leader, and the victim of a 2022 stabbing in New York State that saw him lose his right eye.", "date": "2024-10-08 00:00:00"}]}

This went into action in the Battle of Loos in September 1915 and in the first Battle of the Somme on July 1st 1916. The transmitting portion of set was based on the design of the No 1 Aircraft Spark set. The receiving portion used a carborundum crystal detector. It was powered from an accumulator and also required dry-cell batteries for biasing the carborundum crystal and an internal test buzzer.\n Its range was 3.7km with aerials mounted on masts but this reduced to 1.1km when the aerial was run close to the ground.\n Careful planning of frequencies was required in order to minimize interference from neighbouring spark transmitters, a problem much simplified when CW sets came into use.\n The BF set was used extensively during the second half of the war and approximately 1200 were manufactured.\n 130-watt Wilson Trench Set & Short Wave Tuner Mk. III\nThe Wilson Transmitter was used primarily for Division to Corps communication and Corps Directing Station. This set came into service about the same time as the BF Trench Set. It had a fixed spark gap with a motor-driven, high-speed interrupter rather than the slower magnetic interrupter. The greater number of sparks produced a musical note in the headphones, making the Morse signal more easy to hear through interference. The transmitter had the same frequencies as the BF set and the higher power meant that the range was up to 8.3km.

The telephone, telegraph and the appearance of effective wireless radio sets were replacing older communication methods. The article in Scientific American from March 17, 1917, says:\n“With an army strung out over miles of irregular trenches prompt communication by the older method is obviously impossible, although special instructions carried by fast motorcycles have been found greatly superior to the old horse-mounted messengers; but where rapid communication with the commanders of long lines of trenches, and numerous widely scattered batteries of guns, is necessary something vastly more prompt and certain is required, and in this emergency recourse is had to the telephone, which has proved to be indispensable. By means of telephones, operated through heavily insulated wires that can be run rapidly from point to point, resting directly upon the ground without any supports or elaborate fixtures, orders may be transmitted along miles of trenches within a few minutes, where flags could not be seen, and where messengers even on the fastest motorcycles would require hours, even if they got through safely at all, thus enabling rapid cooperative action to be taken, or special advances organized and properly supported both by troops and guns.”\n A German field telephone setup—portable of course—from 1914. Credit: Scientific American, December 19, 1914\nArtillery, though, frequently cut telephone wires, so “runners” carrying messages back and forth were widely used. As warfare became more mobile late in the war, static telephone lines became less useful, while radios were becoming more portable.

These were adapted to fit the needs of British soldiers in the trenches and ranged from modified cavalry field radios to field communication devices for gun spotters.\n This improved telecommunications equipment made it easier for troops and officers to get information up and down the chain of command; from forces headquarters to the front line and back. One important piece of apparatus for sending intelligence and operational updates was the portable morse code machine, used by the British army throughout the conflict and often in trench holes at the heart of the battle.\n During this period, work was also being done to improve the military’s ability to attack and defend. One of these techniques was sound ranging, a process that uses sound to work out the position and coordinates of enemy artillery firing – you can see the devices used to conduct experiments into sound ranging below in fascinating photographs from the Ministry of Aviation.

Telephones were reliable, but their long, strung-out wires were vulnerable to shellfire and frequently cut. Burying the lines deep into the ground was labour intensive and time consuming, and still did not always protect against shellfire. Pigeons were surprisingly effective in carrying messages, but required special handlers and could become disoriented by the noise of artillery barrages.\n Bulky and Fragile Radios\nWireless telegraphy (radio) could transmit Morse code in 1914, but the wireless sets were bulky and fragile, with relatively short ranges. Later, more robust wireless sets were used by observers to direct artillery fire.\n Limited Communication with Aircraft\nAircraft flew “contact patrols” to observe the forward movement of troops. They were only fitted with transmitting wireless sets, as receivers added too much weight to the airframe. Aircraft could also drop messages near a headquarters or friendly position. Troops on the ground used various methods, such as signal lamps, panels, and flares, to send messages to aircraft.\n Unresolved Problems\nDespite these tools, communication often broke down between the attacking infantry and their headquarters in the rear. When this happened, commanders did not know the location of their troops and were unable to support them with accurate artillery fire, ammunition, or supplies.

This led all the belligerents to develop and use radio (wireless) as an alternate means of communication. Prewar radio sets were too heavy and bulky to be taken into the trenches, and they also required large and highly visible aerials. Radio engineers of the belligerent nations soon developed smaller and more portable sets powered by storage batteries and using low, inconspicuous aerials. Although radio equipment came to be issued to the headquarters of all units, including battalions, the ease of enemy interception, the requirements for cryptographing or encoding messages, and the inherent unreliability of these early systems caused them to be regarded as strictly auxiliary to the wire system and reserved for emergency use when the wire lines were cut. Visual signaling returned to the battlefield in World War I with the use of electric signal lamps. Pyrotechnics, rockets, Very pistols, and flares had a wide use for transmitting prearranged signals. Messenger service came to be highly developed, and motorcycle, bicycle, and automobile messenger service was employed. Homing pigeons were used extensively as one-way messengers from front to rear and acquitted themselves extremely well. Dogs were also used as messengers and, in the German army, reached a high degree of efficiency.\n A new element in warfare, the airplane, introduced in World War I, immediately posed a problem in communication. During most of the war, communication between ground and air was difficult and elementary. To make his reports the pilot had to land or drop messages, and he received instructions while in the air from strips of white and black cloth called “panels” laid out in an open field according to prearranged designs.

The primary functions of the office are to preside over the Supreme Court in its public sessions when the Court is hearing arguments and during its private conferences when it is discussing and deciding cases. Chief justices serve as chair of the Court and have authority to assign the writing of opinions when they are members of the majority; otherwise their powers are the same as those of other Supreme Court justices. The chief justice customarily administers the oath of office to the president and vice president at the time of their inauguration. The chief justice is also the presiding officer of the Judicial Conference of the United States, an assembly of judges representing all the federal courts that reviews and investigates problems relating to the administration of justice in those courts.\n When the office is occupied by a person of extraordinary intellectual capacity and dynamic personality, as was the case with John Marshall (served 1801–35), the chief justice may exert a great influence on the court’s work. Occupants of the centre chair who are lesser figures are likely to be overshadowed by other members of the court.\n The title of chief justice is also usually accorded to the presiding judicial officer within any multi-judge court, as well as to the highest judicial officer within a state of the United States. In the United Kingdom the title of lord chief justice is held by the officer presiding over the judiciary of England and Wales.", "date": "2025-03-04 00:00:00"}]}

The scape is partly hidden within the leaf sheath.[4] Spanish moss propagates both by seed and vegetatively by fragments that are carried on the wind and stick to tree limbs or that are carried to other locations by birds as nesting material.[citation needed]\nSpanish moss is in the family Bromeliaceae (the bromeliads). Formerly, it was placed in the genera Anoplophytum, Caraguata, and Renealmia.[8] The specific name of the plant, usneoides, means \"resembling Usnea\", a lichen.[9]\nSpanish moss is not parasitic: it is an epiphyte that absorbs nutrients and water through its own leaves from the air and rain falling upon it. While its presence rarely kills the trees on which it grows, it occasionally becomes so thick that, by shading the leaves of the tree, it slows the growth rate of the tree.[6] It can use the water-conserving strategy of crassulacean acid metabolism for photosynthesis.[16][17]\nSpanish moss shelters a number of creatures, including rat snakes and three species of bats. One species of jumping spider, Pelegrina tillandsiae, has been found only on Spanish moss.[19] Although widely presumed to infest Spanish moss, in one study of the ecology of the plant, chiggers were not present among thousands of other arthropods identified on the plant.[20]\nSpanish moss is sensitive to airborne contaminants. It does not grow in areas where smoke is common, such as near chimneys. It has receded from urban areas due to increasing air pollution.[6]\nOne anecdote about the origin of Spanish moss is called \"the Meanest Man Who Ever Lived\", in which the man's white hair grew very long and got caught on trees.[21]\nSpanish moss was introduced to Hawaii in the nineteenth century. It became a popular ornamental and lei plant.[15]", "date": "NA"}, {"doc_id": "d2", "title": "Garden Q&A: Amount, not presence, of Spanish moss is the real issue", "url": "https://www.jacksonville.com/story/entertainment/local/2011/04/02/garden-qa-amount-not-presence-spanish-moss-real-issue/15908769007/", "snippet": "Garden Q&A: Amount, not presence, of Spanish moss is the real issue\nMy friend says Spanish moss is a parasite and should be removed from shrubs and trees. I say leave it alone. What do you say?\nMany people mistakenly think that Spanish moss is a parasite and should be removed from landscape plants, but you are correct, it is not a parasite as it does not obtain its nutrition from trees or other plants.\n Spanish moss, Tillandsea usneoides, also called Florida moss, long moss and graybeard is not a true moss. It is an epiphyte, a type of air plant that makes its own food by catching moisture and nutrients from the air.\n There is a caveat here. Too much moss can cause problems for shrubs and trees. If plants become overloaded with moss, the photosynthesis process of the leaves is reduced. This can affect the long term health of plants. Also, excessive moss can weigh down and break branches.\n If you are concerned that any of your shrubs or trees has an excessive amount of moss, you can start by removing the reachable pieces.\n If you are concerned about the presence of moss in large trees, you might want to consult with a certified arborist to see if further action is warranted.\n My Valencia orange tree is loaded with fruit. When is the best time to pick the oranges for juicing?\nValencias are a late season fruit, meaning their harvest time comes at a later date than much of the citrus that we grow here in Northeast Florida. Because of their late maturity, which can subject the fruit to potential freeze damage, we generally don't recommend planting them here. Fortunately for you, it looks like you have found a micro-climate where you are successfully growing Valencias.\n According to the publication \"Citrus Culture in the Home Landscape,\" they can be harvested from March to June. In the southern part of the state, the harvest period is longer.\n Valencias tend to turn golden when they ripen.

It’s often found in swamps and rainforests, and near ponds, streams and lakes.\n description\nNo soil needed\nSpanish moss doesn’t grow from the ground. In fact, it doesn’t have roots. It clings to tree branches and hangs down like a hairy beard. A plant that grows on a different plant is called an epiphyte (rhymes with “peppy fight”). It isn’t a parasite, though. It takes nutrients and water from its surroundings and doesn’t harm the tree.\n New plants\nThe seeds of Spanish moss float through the air like dandelion seeds. If they land on another tree, they grow. But Spanish moss can start a new plant in another way too. Sometimes, parts of it break off. Wind or animals carry the pieces away—maybe to another tree.\n Stayin’ alive\nSpanish moss lives on rain and fog, sunlight, and dust and dirt in the air. Its long tendrils are covered with tiny gray scales that trap and store water. After rain or dense fog, the plant looks greener. As it uses the water, it begins to look gray.\n Horsehair\nYou might see Spanish moss in a floral arrangement, garden art, or in arts and crafts. People once used it to stuff life vests, auto seats, and mattresses. First, they soaked it in water for weeks, until the outer layer rots away. The wiry fiber that's left is sometimes called \"horsehair.\" In the past, Spanish moss has also been used for packing material and for insulation.\n Neighborhood\nSome bats, frogs, and spiders make their homes in clumps of Spanish moss. Some birds line their nests with it.\n No moss here\nSpanish moss isn’t really a type of moss. (Mosses grow from spores, not seeds.) Spanish moss is a type of bromeliad. Bromeliads grow from seeds.

Transcriptomics and metabolomics techniques were used to analyze the response of the plant to Rn exposure. Spanish moss absorbed indoor CO2 at night using the type of photosynthesis termed crassulacean acid metabolism. The CO2 absorption efficiency of the plant was mainly affected by the light duration and diurnal temperature differences. The highest purification efficiency was 48.25%, and the scales on the Spanish moss leaf surface were the key sites for Rn adsorption.", "date": "NA"}, {"doc_id": "d5", "title": "Tillandsia usneoides Spanish Moss | Tropical Biodiversity", "url": "https://blogs.reading.ac.uk/tropical-biodiversity/2013/11/tillandsia-usneoides-spanish-moss/", "snippet": "Tillandsia usneoides Spanish Moss\nLacking ideas this Movember? Why not take inspiration from Spanish Moss and the great Spanish explorer Hernando De Soto, from whom the plant was thought to originate. Well at least as the legend goes…\nApparently Hernando De Soto pursued an Indian maiden through the forest and up a live oak tree. During the chase his gray beard became entangled in the tree, giving the maiden an opportunity to escape. De Soto freed himself, but several wisps of his beard were left behind. These remnants became Spanish Moss [1].\n The name Spanish Moss is quite misleading. Firstly, this plant isn’t even Spanish. The dangling beard-like festoons are found across much of the Americas adorning bald cypress (Taxodium distichum) and southern live oak trees (Quercus virginiana) or even telephone wires and fences. Spanish Moss isn’t a moss either. It belongs to Bromeliaceae a family of frequently epiphytic, rosette plants with spirally arranged leaves. It is likely to have been earned its rather confusing name because of its moss-like appearance and abundance throughout much of the former Spanish colonies of the New World [1].\n The more reliable binomial for Spanish Moss is Tillandsia usneoides (L.)L. The genus Tillandsia was named after after a Swedish physician and botanist Elias Tillandz, while the the specific epithet usneoides means ‘resembles usnea’, a genus of lichens also known as the beard lichens[5].\n Amazing adaptations!\n T. usneoides is arguably the most specialised member of Bromeliaceae. Itis a slender epiphytic perennial which has shed the requirement for roots, relying upon its corkscrew-like stems and acicular (needle like) leaves to tangle around themselves and other objects for support. It hangs in festoons around 8m long and has been reported to grow up to 30m long as a result of numerous shorter individual plants overlapping each other", "date": "NA"}]}

Patients should review their insurance policy and consult with their provider to understand the specific costs they will be responsible for.\n In addition to hospital fees, there are also surgeon fees to consider. Surgeon fees can vary depending on the complexity of the procedure and the surgeon's experience. It is crucial for patients to discuss these fees with their surgeon and understand what is included in the cost.\n Medication and Follow-up Care Costs\nAfter heart valve replacement surgery, patients may require medications to prevent infection, reduce the risk of blood clots, and manage other post-surgical complications. The cost of these medications can vary depending on factors such as insurance coverage and the specific medications prescribed.\n Some medications may need to be taken for a short period, while others may be required for a longer duration. It is important for patients to discuss the potential costs of these medications with their healthcare provider and explore options for financial assistance if needed.\n In addition to medications, regular follow-up care appointments with cardiologists and surgeons are necessary to monitor recovery and ensure optimal heart function. These appointments may involve additional costs, including diagnostic tests and imaging studies. The frequency and duration of follow-up care will depend on the individual patient's needs and the recommendations of their healthcare team.\n It is essential for patients to factor in these ongoing costs when planning for heart valve replacement surgery.

The aortic and mitral valves are the ones that surgeons most commonly replace. Most valve replacement surgeries are successful.\n When a person needs a heart valve replacement, doctors may use one of the following types of valves for the procedure:\nmechanical valves\nallografts, which are made from tissues harvested from a donor’s heart\npig valves\ncow valves\nSurgery\nA doctor may also recommend the Ross Procedure for a damaged aortic valve. This procedure involves swapping the person’s damaged aortic valve with their pulmonary valve and replacing the pulmonary valve with a donor valve.\n Replacing a heart valve often involves open-heart surgery.\n However, another option is transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), a less invasive procedure. Newer surgical techniques are emerging, such as robot-assisted procedures, which are also less invasive.\n Preparation for a valve replacement depends on the type of procedure a person is having.\n Prior to open-heart surgery, people will typically meet with the medical team performing the procedure to discuss the steps involved and any possible risks and complications.\n People will likely have to stay in the hospital the night before surgery to have blood work and other testing done. They must not eat after midnight before the surgery.\n Before the surgery, a hospital employee will shave the surgical area and direct the person to put on a hospital gown. They may administer a sedative to help the person relax. They will then move the person to the operating area, where the person will receive general anesthesia.\n Open-heart valve replacement\nThis type of replacement procedure involves opening up the chest to replace a damaged valve. To replace a valve, the medical team will have to stop the heart for 1 hour and use a heart-lung machine to continue circulating blood in the person’s body.\n Once the surgeons close the incision, the person will go to the intensive care unit (ICU).", "date": "Aug 31, 2022"}, {"doc_id": "d3", "title": "Costs of Heart Valve Surgery", "url": "https://www.heart-valve-surgery.com/costs-fees-estimates-money-insurance.php", "snippet": "Costs of Heart Valve Surgery\nMy number one priority for heart valve surgery focused on finding the right surgeon. I remember thinking, “Money is no object for this procedure. I don’t care what it costs. I want to find the best surgeon. I want the best care. I will go anywhere to have this done. I’ll worry about the fees afterward.”\n A long time ago, a friend once said to me, “When you die, the money in your bank account is irrelevant.” That might be cliche, but I believe it. That is why I was so adamant about finding the top cardiac surgeon for my heart valve replacement.\n Still, one of the most curious questions I had about heart valve surgery was, “How much is valve surgery going to cost me?”\nUnfortunately, no one I spoke with seemed to have a reliable answer to that question. My uncle told me, “A procedure like that will probably cost over $100,000.” Another buddy said, “My cousin had some valve work done... I hear it cost him $200,000.”\n I then went to the Internet and searched the world wide web for an answer. I never really found anything that detailed how much a heart valve surgery actually cost the patient.\n Eventually though, I found three references to heart valve surgery costs from Columbia University, The National Library of Medicine and East Carolina University. Here is what the references said:\nColumbia University. Between 1992 and 1997, length of hospital stay decreased from 13.4 to 8.0 days and cost decreased from $37,047 to $21,856. Similarly, between 1992 and 1997 for mitral valve repair, length of stay decreased from 15.6 to 8.1 days and cost decreased from $45,072 to $21,747. The net result over the time period from 1988 to 1997 was an average decline in the cost of operation of $785 a year, adjusted for other factors.\n National Library of Medicine.", "date": "Sep 17, 2020"}, {"doc_id": "d4", "title": "Relative Costs of Surgical and Transcatheter Aortic Valve ...", "url": "https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCINTERVENTIONS.119.008681", "snippet": "The average aggregate 6-month inpatient costs were $59 743 for SAVR, $64 395 for TAVR, and $23 460 for MT.", "date": "May 14, 2020"}, {"doc_id": "d5", "title": "Cost Analysis of Isolated Mitral Valve Surgery in the United States", "url": "https://www.annalsthoracicsurgery.org/article/S0003-4975(12)01308-2/fulltext", "snippet": "The mean and median typical cost for mitral valve repair was $30,720 and $28,717, respectively.

That’s a lot of money!” On the other hand, you might think, “That’s it! To keep me alive for another 10, 20 or 30 years… That’s nothing!” (Personally, the latter thought rushed through my brain as I digested these numbers.)\n Regardless of how you view the cost of heart valve replacement devices, we should probably remember that mechanical and bioprosthetic devices fall into the life sciences product category. The leading valve manufacturers — Edwards, Medtronic, ATS, St. Jude — have to extend millions, or even billions, of dollars on research and development (R&D) before they make one penny on a product sale. That said, pricing usually starts high as R&D costs are recouped. Then, over time, pricing decreases – just like the computer in front of you.

Today I’m sharing my guide to the best things to see and do (and eat!) in The Loop, West Loop, and River North – or the areas most would consider downtown. But before we jump into the guide, here are five fun facts to get you acquainted with the city quickly:\nFive Things You May Not Know About Chicago\nThe famed American roadway Route 66 begins in Chicago (unless you’re starting on the other end, in L.A.!) – you can find the route marker near the main entrance to the Art Institute of Chicago.\n The Chicago River is the only river in the world that has been reversed to run backward. Instead of running toward Lake Michigan, it now runs away from it.\n The Centennial Wheel at Navy Pier is now an iconic part of the Chicago skyline, but its importance to the city runs deeper than just sheer thrills. When Chicago hosted the World’s Fair in 1893, the Ferris wheel was the centerpiece of the exhibition – and the very first one.\n Commercial rent for properties along The Magnificent Mile (a 13-block portion of Michigan Avenue with hundreds of luxury retailers) is currently the third-highest in the nation – after Fifth Avenue in NYC and Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills.\n Now, let’s go visit!\n THINGS TO DO IN CHICAGO\nArts, culture, sports - Chicago has it all.

Solar eclipses occur when the Moon comes between the Sun and Earth. Such eclipses are either total, when the Moon completely blocks the Sun; annular, when the Moon is far from Earth and so covers the central part of the Sun, allowing the narrow ring of the Sun’s edge to shine around the Moon; or partial, when the Moon covers only some of the Sun. Lunar eclipses can be total, when the Moon passes through Earth’s shadow; partial, when the Moon goes through only some of Earth’s shadow; or penumbral, when the Moon goes through only the outermost parts of Earth’s shadow and thus dims only slightly.\n The table below lists all the eclipses that will occur in 2024, 2025, and 2026 and where on Earth they will occur.

Due to Earth's curvature, Earth may move through the Antumbral shadow (Annular eclipse) and Umbral shadow (Total eclipse) along different points of the eclipse path.\n DO NOT observe a solar eclipse with the naked eye. Serious eye damage can result. Use approved solar filters or cut a pin hole in a shoe box and watch the Sun's light cast through the pin hole onto a smooth surface such as cardboard. The only portion of a solar eclipse which is safe to view without filters is the brief time during totality. Otherwise all partial solar eclipses need approved filters. For approved filters, look for a certification of International Standard ISO 12312-2. The next solar eclipse which will be visible in the United States will occur on April 8, 2024.\nDATES OF UPCOMING TOTAL AND ANNULAR SOLAR ECLIPSES AND LOCATIONS OF BEST VIEWING\nA Lunar eclipse occurs when the Sun casts Earth's shadow onto the Moon. For this to happen, the Earth must be physically between the Sun and Moon with all three bodies lying on the same plane of orbit. A lunar eclipse can only occur during a Full Moon and when the Moon passes through all or a portion of Earth's shadow.\n The outer portion of the shadow cast from Earth is known as the penumbral shadow, which is an area where Earth obstructs only a part of the Sun's light from reaching the Moon. The umbral shadow is the \"inner\" shadow, which is the area where Earth blocks all direct sunlight from reaching the Moon. A penumbral lunar eclipse is subtle and very difficult to observe. A partial lunar eclipse is when a portion of the Moon passes through the Earth's umbral shadow.

Because the G3P exported from the chloroplast has three carbon atoms, it takes three “turns” of the Calvin cycle to fix enough net carbon to export one G3P. But each turn makes two G3Ps, thus three turns make six G3Ps. One is exported while the remaining five G3P molecules remain in the cycle and are used to regenerate RuBP, which enables the system to prepare for more CO2 to be fixed. Three more molecules of ATP are used in these regeneration reactions.\n Key Points\nThe Calvin cycle refers to the light-independent reactions in photosynthesis that take place in three key steps.\n Although the Calvin Cycle is not directly dependent on light, it is indirectly dependent on light since the necessary energy carriers (ATP and NADPH) are products of light-dependent reactions.\n In fixation, the first stage of the Calvin cycle, light-independent reactions are initiated; CO2 is fixed from an inorganic to an organic molecule.\n In the second stage, ATP and NADPH are used to reduce 3-PGA into G3P; then ATP and NADPH are converted to ADP and NADP+, respectively.\n In the last stage of the Calvin Cycle, RuBP is regenerated, which enables the system to prepare for more CO2 to be fixed.", "date": "2024-11-23 00:00:00"}, {"doc_id": "d8", "title": "C4 carbon fixation - Wikipedia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C4_carbon_fixation", "snippet": "C4 fixation is an addition to the ancestral and more common C3 carbon fixation. The main carboxylating enzyme in C3 photosynthesis is called RuBisCO, which catalyses two distinct reactions using either CO2 (carboxylation) or oxygen (oxygenation) as a substrate. RuBisCO oxygenation gives rise to phosphoglycolate, which is toxic and requires the expenditure of energy to recycle through photorespiration. C4 photosynthesis reduces photorespiration by concentrating CO2 around RuBisCO.\n To enable RuBisCO to work in a cellular environment where there is a lot of carbon dioxide and very little oxygen, C4 leaves generally contain two partially isolated compartments called mesophyll cells and bundle-sheath cells. CO2 is initially fixed in the mesophyll cells in a reaction catalysed by the enzyme PEP carboxylase in which the three-carbon phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) reacts with CO2 to form the four-carbon oxaloacetic acid (OAA). OAA can then be reduced to malate or transaminated to aspartate. These intermediates diffuse to the bundle sheath cells, where they are decarboxylated, creating a CO2-rich environment around RuBisCO and thereby suppressing photorespiration. The resulting pyruvate (PYR), together with about half of the phosphoglycerate (PGA) produced by RuBisCO, diffuses back to the mesophyll. PGA is then chemically reduced and diffuses back to the bundle sheath to complete the reductive pentose phosphate cycle (RPP). This exchange of metabolites is essential for C4 photosynthesis to work.\n Additional biochemical steps require more energy in the form of ATP to regenerate PEP, but concentrating CO2 allows high rates of photosynthesis at higher temperatures.

This pathway was called the Calvin cycle or photosynthetic carbon reduction (PCR) cycle and began with the incorporation of carbon dioxide (CO2) into the 5-carbon sugar ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP) to form a six-carbon intermediate which immediately splits to form two C3 molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate. In the latter half of the next decade Marshall Hatch and Roger Slack with, PhD students Hilary Johnson and John Andrews, working at the Brisbane laboratory of the Colonial Sugar Refining Co Ltd., provided evidence for the mechanism, enzymology and regulation of an alternative photosynthetic process operating in leaves of sugarcane. In this process, the first products of CO2 fixation are the C4 dicarboxylic acids, malate, aspartate and oxaloacetate, not the C3 molecule 3-phosphoglycerate. They named the process the C4 dicarboxylic pathway of photosynthesis, abbreviated later to the C4 pathway or C4 photosynthesis. Several other grass species and some species from other families were shown to have a similar mechanism. This alternative process, the NADP-malic enzyme-type, is one of three types of C4 photosynthesis subsequently identified in later years.\n With the closure of the CSR Brisbane laboratory in 1970, Marshall Hatch took up a position with the CSIRO Division of Plant Industry where he continued studies on this process until his retirement in 1997. Major contributions during that time included aspects of the resolution of the mechanism of two alternative biochemical options for C4 photosynthesis, details of the regulation of these processes and their role as CO2 concentrating mechanisms, identification of new enzymes, details of the regulation of key enzymes and their intracellular location and studies on the fluxes of metabolites between cells. He and colleagues finally identified all but one of the ten major enzymes involved in C4 photosynthesis.", "date": "2016-03-23 00:00:00"}]}

Nowadays, only symptomatic treatments exist for this disease, all trying to counterbalance the neurotransmitter disturbance: 3 cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine. To block the progression of the disease, therapeutic agents are supposed to interfere with the pathogenic steps responsible for the clinical symptoms, classically including the deposition of extracellular amyloid β plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangle formation. Other underlying mechanisms are targeted by neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, growth factor promotive, metabolic efficacious agents and stem cell therapies. Recent therapies have integrated multiple new features such as novel biomarkers, new neuropsychological outcomes, enrollment of earlier populations in the course of the disease, and innovative trial designs. In the near future different specific agents for every patient might be used in a “precision medicine” context, where aberrant biomarkers accompanied with a particular pattern of neuropsychological and neuroimaging findings could determine a specific treatment regimen within a customized therapeutic framework. In this review, we discuss potential disease-modifying therapies that are currently being studied and potential individualized therapeutic frameworks that can be proved beneficial for patients with AD.\nIntroduction\nAlzheimer disease (AD) is one of the greatest medical care challenges of our century and is the main cause of dementia.", "date": "2020-02-29"}, {"doc_id": "d8", "title": "Medications for Memory, Cognition & Dementia-Related Behaviors", "url": "https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/treatments/medications-for-memory", "snippet": "Although current medications cannot cure Alzheimer's, two U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatments address the underlying biology.

The site was surrounded by water on three sides (it was not fully an island yet) and was far inland; both meant it was easily defensible against possible Spanish attacks. The water was also deep enough that the English could tie their ships at the shoreline - good parking! The site was also not inhabited by the Native population.\n Once the spot was chosen the instructions sent by the Virginia Company, with the list of the council members (chosen by officials in England), was read. The names were kept in a sealed box on the ship (each ship had a sealed copy). The first President of the new Virginia colony was to be Edward Maria Winfield. The other six council members were: Bartholomew Gosnold, Christopher Newport, John Martin, John Ratcliffe, George Kendall, and John Smith.\n By June 15, the fort was completed. It was triangle shaped with a bulwark at each corner, holding four or five pieces of artillery. The settlers were now protected against any attacks that might occur from the local Powhatan Indians, whose hunting land they were living on. Relations had already been mixed between the newcomers and the Powhatan Indians. On June 22, Captain Newport left for England to get more supplies for the new settlement.\n Not long after Captain Newport left, the settlers began to succumb to a variety of diseases.

You never heard of a horse going broke betting on people.” –Will Rogers\nWe know from old movies that once upon a time, people traveled by horse. When did people switch from horses to cars? How were they persuaded to make that switch?\n It all happened in a single decade, beginning in 1907. That’s when the car began to come into its own, replacing the horse and the bicycle as a means for transporting people and goods, across the United States. At that time, there were just 140,300 registered cars and only 2,900 trucks in America.\n They’d Stopped Riding Horses\nPeople still traveled by railroad for long distances, and by foot or horse-drawn carriage for shorter distances. Goods were transported in much the same way. But by this time in history, just about no one rode horses. Lots of people, however, rode bicycles for fun and for carrying things from place to place.\n By 1917, just ten years later, the number of registered cars had increased 33 fold, to nearly 5 million, with a 134-fold increase in other vehicles (commercial, agricultural, and military) so that they now numbered close to 400,000. It had become downright dangerous for horses to be out on the road. Cars now ruled.

Transmissions and throttle controls were widely adopted, allowing a variety of cruising speeds.

Horses were used for work, transport, war and many other purposes. Yet, these days most of those tasks are now carried out by cars or other motorised vehicles.\n The history of Horses and Humans\nHumans domesticated the horse about 6,000 years ago. This led to us being able to use the power and durability of these animals to allow society to progress. People could now travel longer distances and to carry out tasks such as farming more easily.\n From their beginning in the Eurasian steppes, horses spread out over the planet. The European explorers and settlers took them to lands like America, where horses quickly adapted and became a huge part of life for natives and settlers alike.\n The switch to Motorised Vehicles\nThe Industrial Revolution showed us that machines were the future. Yet, horses remained in place as one of our most valuable methods of transportation and brute strength. There are famous pictures of horses being used in battles as late as World War One, where up to eight million of them lost their lives. But by then the end of their use as the most common transport method was near.\n The switch to cars happened very quickly, with the US leading the way. In a single decade, the American roads went from having just over 140,000 cars (in 1907) to close to five million in 1917. The number of commercial and agricultural vehicles increased at an even greater rate in this period.\n Another set of figures from the US shows that there were 22 million horses in 1925 but only 18 million five years later, followed by further declines. On the other hand, cars rose from 20 million to over 26 million in the same period. By now, horses were far less commonly used as a transport method in North America.\n This story tells us how Brooklyn replaced its horse-drawn fire engine with a motorized version in 1922. It was a story that was repeated across the planet, as new technology came into reach for more and more people who had previously relied on equine power.", "date": "2021-04-27 00:00:00"}, {"doc_id": "d8", "title": "Early Cars: Fact Sheet for Children - Smithsonian Institution", "url": "https://www.si.edu/spotlight/early-cars", "snippet": "This process made steam that expanded and pushed pistons, which turned a crankshaft. An electric car had a battery that powered a small electric motor, which turned a drive shaft. A gasoline car ignited fuel that caused a small explosion inside each cylinder. This explosion pushed the piston and turned a crankshaft connected to the wheels by a chain or drive shaft.\n Who drove the first cars?\n In 1900 wealthy people bought cars for pleasure, comfort, and status. Many doctors bought small, affordable cars because they were more dependable than horses and easier to keep ready. Rural Americans liked cars because they could cover long distances without depending on trains. They carried produce to market, went to stores and movies in town, and even used their cars to plow fields. Families in towns and cities liked cars because they were handy for errands, going to the train station, visiting relatives, going to church, and going on drives in the country. A family’s house with a car in the driveway has been a common sight since about 1910. Young people liked cars because they could go to movies, restaurants, and other fun places instead of staying at home with their parents.\n Why do so many people use cars?\n Cars are fast, comfortable, nice looking, and fun to drive. They can go almost anywhere, and they are always ready for use. In many ways, driving is easier than walking, biking, or riding in a train, bus, or airplane. But owning a car is a big responsibility. It takes a lot of money to buy one and keep it running, and drivers must be trained, licensed, and always alert to avoid mistakes and accidents. It takes a lot of space to park cars, and too many cars cause congestion on roads and in parking lots. Some car owners have returned to walking, biking, or riding a train or bus when it’s more practical or convenient. For most Americans, cars are a favorite way to travel, but there will always be a need for other types of transportation.\n What was different about the Ford Model T?", "date": "2018-01-01"}, {"doc_id": "d9", "title": "Horses Go Out of Business: Technology That Changed Chicago", "url": "https://www.chipublib.org/blogs/post/technology-that-changed-chicago-horses-go-out-of-business/", "snippet": "In 1950 only 329 horse-drawn vehicles were left.

The only actual count of horses that I have been able to find comes from the Bureau of Streets as reported in the Annual Report of the Department of Public Works. In 1907, they counted 77,147 horses.\n An immense volume of manure had to be swept up and carted off. Especially after 1900, the flies and smell began to be considered problems.

However, they can be administered by a variety of health care providers.\n The most effective tests for detecting cancer\nAlthough blood tests are useful, other tests are almost always necessary for diagnosing cancer. These include:\nMany health care providers encourage women to get a baseline mammogram at age 40 and every year thereafter. Women who have a family history of breast cancer should discuss their risk factors with their health care providers and consider screenings at an earlier age.\n Similarly for lung cancer, the most common cancer in the world, any individual with a significant smoking history should get a CT scan between 50 and 80 years old. During a CT scan, you lie on a table and an X-ray machine uses a low dose of radiation to make detailed images of your lungs.\n The importance of early cancer detection\n Regardless of your type of cancer, early detection is key to ensuring optimal outcomes.\n \"Early detection of cancer is important because cancer is typically divided into various stages depending on what part of the body it's involving,\" says Nebraska Medicine cancer doctor, Apar Kishor Ganti, MD, MS.", "date": "NA"}, {"doc_id": "d2", "title": "Do Routine Blood Tests Detect Cancer? | Mira", "url": "https://www.talktomira.com/post/do-routine-blood-tests-detect-cancer", "snippet": "Explore Categories\nExplore Tags\nDo Routine Blood Tests Detect Cancer?\nRoutine blood work can detect early signs of cancers, particularly blood cancers such as leukemia and lymphoma. Routine blood tests are recommended for healthy individuals. They can also give insight into organ function, diet, metabolism, and even detect signs of cancer. Four types of blood tests detect cancer, as explained in this article.\n Purpose of Routine Blood Work\nRoutine blood work refers to blood tests ordered by your doctor as part of your yearly physical. They are used to screen for a range of health conditions, helping you make informed diet, lifestyle, and fitness choices. Routine blood work can also detect illness before symptoms arise. A routine complete blood count test (CBC) is also commonly referred to as routine blood work.\n Factors That Influence Recommended Blood Tests\nNot everyone is recommended the same blood tests. Your family history, age, sex, personal risk factors, and current health status influence the frequency and type of blood tests a doctor might recommend.

Knowing if the tumor has PD-L1 will help your doctor decide if certain types of immunotherapy are more or less likely to be helpful (see Types of Treatment).\n Currently, there are different biomarker tests that can be done to determine if you have any genetic changes. Sometimes, there may not be enough tissue to test for all of the mutations. Your health care team may decide to test for the most likely changes or they may need to do another biopsy to get enough tissue. Learn more about biomarker testing in lung cancer.\n Liquid biopsy. A type of blood test called a \"liquid biopsy\" is being used more and more to help diagnose specific genetic changes in people with NSCLC, but it cannot be used to diagnose the cancer itself. This test looks for a type of DNA called \"circulating tumor DNA.\" Like healthy cells, cancer cells die and are replaced. When these dead cells break down, they are released into the bloodstream. A liquid biopsy can detect the small pieces of DNA in the bloodstream from these cells.\n Liquid biopsies are less invasive than other types of biopsies and have less risks. Liquid biopsies can be done as a part of your initial diagnosis and they can be done multiple times throughout treatment. Learn more about liquid biopsy and what to expect.\n After diagnostic tests are done, your doctor will review all of the results with you. If the diagnosis is cancer, these results also help the doctor describe the cancer. This is called staging.\n Coping with an NSCLC diagnosis\nFor most patients, a diagnosis of NSCLC is extremely stressful. Some people who are diagnosed with NSCLC develop anxiety and, less commonly, depression. You and your families should not be afraid to talk with the health care team about how you feel.

The Galleri multi-cancer early detection test can detect cancer signals across more than 50 types of cancer, as defined by the American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging Manual, through a routine blood draw. When a cancer signal is detected, the Galleri test predicts the cancer signal origin, or where the cancer is located in the body, with high accuracy to help guide the next steps to diagnosis. The Galleri test requires a prescription from a licensed health care provider and should be used in addition to recommended cancer screenings such as mammography, colonoscopy, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test, or cervical cancer screening. It is intended for use in people with an elevated risk of cancer, such as those aged 50 or older. For more information about Galleri, visit galleri.com.\n Important Galleri Safety Information The Galleri test is recommended for use in adults with an elevated risk for cancer, such as those aged 50 or older. The Galleri test may not detect a cancer signal across all cancers and should be used in addition to routine cancer screening tests recommended by a health care provider. Galleri is intended to detect cancer signals and predict where in the body the cancer signal is located. Use of Galleri is not recommended in individuals who are pregnant, 21 years old or younger, or undergoing active cancer treatment.\n Results should be interpreted by a health care provider in the context of medical history, clinical signs and symptoms. A test result of “Cancer Signal Not Detected” does not rule out cancer. A test result of “Cancer Signal Detected” requires confirmatory diagnostic evaluation by medically established procedures (e.g. imaging) to confirm cancer.\n If cancer is not confirmed with further testing, it could mean that cancer is not present or testing was insufficient to detect cancer, including due to the cancer being located in a different part of the body.

After all, future generations cannot quench the violent potential of humanity without intentional self-education.\n Reconquista - 781 Years\nThe Capitulation of Granada, 1492.\n Spanning an incredible 781 years, the Reconquista was a long and arduous war fought by Spanish and Portuguese forces against the Muslim rulers of the Iberian Peninsula. The conflict began around 711 CE when an Islamic-Berber army crossed the Straight of Gibraltar. These invaders entered Spain and Portugal, and by 718 CE, the Moors controlled much of Iberia. Christian Kingdoms fell to the prowess of the Cordoban Caliphate until the caliph disintegrated in the 11th century. After that point, Christian kingdoms slowly resurged and grew to dominate the peninsula. Though there were a series of defeats and victories on both sides throughout these centuries, eventually, in 1492 CE, Granada in present-day southern Andalusia finally fell to Ferdinand II and Isabella I.

The longest war in U.S. history has come at the financial cost of close to $1 trillion. It has killed more than 2,000 American soldiers and, according to some estimates, hundreds of thousands of Afghans.\n The United States invaded Afghanistan on October 7, 2001. President George W. Bush authorized the war in response to 9/11—Taliban-ruled Afghanistan was providing refuge for al Qaeda, the terrorist organization that had orchestrated the attacks. Al Qaeda’s leader, Osama bin Laden, evaded the U.S. military for a decade, but the Taliban regime fell within weeks. U.S. and allied forces stayed in Afghanistan to support a new government in Kabul. But the Taliban soon regrouped. For years, the fighting ebbed and surged as Washington tossed around versions of the same questions: With more time and resources, could the U.S. military finally rout the Taliban and the terrorists they had harbored? Was staying the course a better option than risking the collapse of the fledgling Afghan state? Or was it necessary to find a way out, whether by negotiation or unilateral withdrawal?\n Over the past two decades, senior officials—including U.S. ambassadors, commanders of U.S. and NATO military forces, and the current president of Afghanistan—as well as leading scholars and journalists have assessed the progress of the war and the prospects of its resolution in the pages of Foreign Affairs.

The war is one of the longest in American history, roughly double the time the nation spent in both of the world wars combined. But in the context of world history, there are wars that dwarf the conflict. (Also check out: The 35 billion-dollar weapons in the U.S. Military budget.)\n Some wars are quick, especially for countries who spend a lot on their military. But this is not always the case. Before technology made it possible to kill many enemies from anywhere, opposing sides could retreat, take refuge in a fortified castle, and wait to go back out and fight. This allowed some wars in the past to drag out decades and even centuries.\n 24/7 Wall St. has compiled a list of the longest wars in history by reviewing data and articles from various sources. In order to appear on this list, a conflict had to meet the definition of war as an open and usually declared armed conflict between political entities such as sovereign states or competing factions within the same state, such as a civil war. The conflict had to be sustained over a period of time and intended to resolve political or territorial disputes.\n In the early 18th century, Sweden was the dominant power in the Baltic region. Three neighboring kingdoms — Russia, Denmark-Norway, and Saxony-Poland — formed a coalition to attack Sweden. They attacked after King Charles XI died and his 14-year-old son Charles XII was crowned. As the war continued, England and Prussia also joined the Russian coalition, sensing an opportunity to gain more land and resources. Finally, after more than two decades of fighting, Sweden surrendered and forfeited much of its territory and wealth to its opponents. This event helped turn Russia into the world power it is today and damaged Sweden’s influence on the world stage.\n The Peloponnesian War was a conflict between Greek city states — one side led by Athens and the other by Sparta.

All penguins maintain a body temperature between 100 and 102 degrees Fahrenheit (around 38°C) but they live in temperatures that range from 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32°C) along the coast of Patagonia to negative 76 degrees Fahrenheit (-60°C) on the sea ice of Antarctica. Feathers account for nearly 85 percent of a bird’s insulation, and when the weather is warm that insulation can make temperatures a bit toasty. The banded penguins, such as the Humboldt and African penguins, have featherless patches on their faces and feet where they divert blood to cool when overheated. In contrast, the Adélie penguin, one of two Antarctic species, has complete feather coverage up to the base of its beak.\n Although feathers can be fluffed up or flattened down, penguins also use other methods to keep their temperatures at the right level. When an Adélie penguin overheats it diverts blood to its thin wings, causing the white undersides to turn a faint pink color.

By taking action now, we can help these remarkable creatures continue to thrive in their icy environments for generations to come.\n Conclusion\nIn conclusion, penguins are perfectly adapted to live in cold places due to their unique physical characteristics and behavioral adaptations. Their thick layer of blubber, waterproof feathers, and counter-current heat exchange system help them stay warm in freezing temperatures. Their streamlined bodies and webbed feet enable them to swim efficiently in icy waters, while their ability to dive deep allows them to find food in the cold ocean. Penguins also gather in large colonies, which provides them with additional warmth and protection. Despite the harsh conditions, penguins have found a way to thrive in these cold environments, making them truly remarkable creatures. So, the next time you see a penguin waddling on the ice, remember that they are perfectly suited to their chilly homes.\n Frequently Asked Questions\nQ1: Why do penguins live in the cold?\nPenguins are adapted to live in cold climates like the Antarctic habitat. Their bodies have evolved over time to withstand freezing temperatures. They have a layer of fat under their skin for thermal insulation and their feathers provide an additional layer of warmth.\n Q2: Do all penguins live in cold climates?\n No, not all penguins live in cold climates. While many species are found in Antarctica and other icy habitats, some species like the Galapagos penguin live in warmer climates near the equator.\n Q3: How do penguins survive in cold weather?\nPenguins have several survival strategies for cold weather. They have a high body fat percentage that provides thermal insulation. Their feathers are waterproof and trap a layer of air for additional insulation. Penguins also huddle together in large groups to share body heat.\n Q4: What penguins live in cold climates?", "date": "NA"}, {"doc_id": "d3", "title": "Can Penguins Live in Warm Weather? - Frosty Arctic", "url": "https://frostyarctic.com/can-penguins-live-in-warm-weather/", "snippet": "Can Penguins Live in Warm Weather?\n The answer is yes. Penguins can live in warm regions as well! Almost 14 species of penguins are currently living in areas with warm climates. Only four species of penguins live in cold regions. Even the African penguin, the jackass penguin, can survive in hot weather.\n If you’ve also known that penguins live in cold regions only, now you know that’s not the truth. What if there are more such facts that you don’t know of? Well, let’s see then!\n About Penguins’ Life in Warm Weather\nSince penguins do not only live in cold regions and actually can also survive in warm regions, let’s learn more about their lives in areas where the weather is warm. There are about 14 different species of penguins that live in warm areas.\n Penguins’ lives seem to be pretty fun in warm areas. Penguins survive in warm regions by stretching their flippers (wings) out to the side and leaning over to shade their feet from the sun. They protect their eggs from the heat of the sun by laying them in cracks and creases of rocks.\n Warm-weather penguins have the same height as penguins in Antarctica. However, they have some distinct features that allow them to survive in warm temperatures. If their body temperatures become higher than normal, they also pant to cool down again.\n What Temperatures do Penguins Live in?\nPenguins live in a variety of temperatures because many penguin species have different habitats. Some mostly only live in the southern hemisphere, in Antarctica, whereas some live in the northern hemisphere too.\n Penguins can survive temperatures from 32 degrees centigrade to 22 degrees Celsius in warmer areas such as Patagonia, Argentina. If the climate gets too hot for these penguins, they spread their wings and lean over their feet to lose some body temperature to remain cool.\n Why can’t most Penguins Survive the Heat?\nEven though some penguins live in warm areas, most penguins are still unable to survive the heat.", "date": "NA"}, {"doc_id": "d4", "title": "Letter from Stephanie: Antarctic Adaptations | AMNH", "url": "https://www.amnh.org/learn-teach/curriculum-collections/antarctica/organisms/antarctic-adaptations", "snippet": "The dark plumage of a penguin's dorsal surface (her back) absorbs heat from the Sun, which increases body temperature further.\n What about all that ice? On land, Emperor penguins rest their entire weight on their heels and tail, reducing contact of their feet with the icy surface. They can also tuck their flippers in close to their bodies and shiver to generate additional heat. And they have very powerful noses! Emperor penguins are able to recapture 80% of heat escaping in their breath through a complex heat exchange system in their nasal passages.\n Emperor penguins are so well-suited to cold, they can overheat on land; so they also need adaptations that allow them to cool down. The penguin's circulatory system can actually adjust to environmental conditions, either conserving or releasing body heat to keep body temperature constant. To conserve heat, blood flowing to the flippers and legs transfers its heat to blood returning to the heart, thus helping to keep heat in the body. To cool off, penguins can ruffle their feathers, breaking up the insulating air layer next to the skin and releasing heat. Penguins can also hold their flippers away from their bodies, exposing both surfaces of the flippers to air; this releases heat. (That's the same reason that a dog lets his tongue roll out on hot days!)\n Emperor penguins have also developed adaptations in their breeding patterns. Unlike other Antarctic birds, Emperors breed in the Antarctic fall/winter, around April, laying their eggs in May. This ensures that the chicks hatch in the late winter, when resources are becoming available, and that the chicks have more time to develop in mild conditions.\n The females don't stay home with the eggs, either! Male Emperors remain on the sea ice platform and incubate the eggs while the females return to the ocean to feed.

But, some species which are suitable for cold environments cannot persist in warm weathers.\n Conversely, if the penguin of the cold climate gets born in the warm weather, it could be probable that owing to the adaptation difficulties, it might not survive for the elongated period.\n It is not mandatory that penguins need icy and snowy regions for their survival.

They get their name from the Humboldt Current, which flows up from Antarctica along the coast of South America. So the warm Hawaiian weather is actually quite comfortable for them, and if they ever need to cool off they can always take a swim.\n The water in the penguin habitat is salt water – penguins are actually a type of seabird! Sea Life Park pumps about 12 million gallons of fresh sea water through our habitats every day. We do not put any kind of chemicals into that water, so algae grows naturally in our habitats. This algae called diatoms actually absorb harmful sunlight and produce atmospheric oxygen.\n Adaptations\nPenguins are birds however they cannot fly. They have many adaptations for swimming and survival in the water. Their wings are shaped like paddles, which enables them to swim up to speeds of 9 miles per hour. They can also dive about 1 to 2 meters deep, and hold their breath for about 1 minute. However, the deepest penguin dive was recorded at 1, 752 feet.\n Why Are Penguins Black & White?\nA penguins coloration is actually a type of camouflage called counter-shading. The back is black because looking down through the water the dark color blends in with the dark colors of the ocean, and the front is white because if a predator was looking up, the penguin would blend in with the light from the sun reflecting on the water.", "date": "NA"}]}

General Motors has said it aims to stop selling new gasoline-powered cars and light trucks by 2035 and will pivot to battery-powered models. This week, Volvo said it would move even faster and introduce an all-electric lineup by 2030.\n But as electric cars and trucks go mainstream, they have faced a persistent question: Are they really as green as advertised?\nWhile experts broadly agree that plug-in vehicles are a more climate-friendly option than traditional vehicles, they can still have their own environmental impacts, depending on how they’re charged up and manufactured. Here’s a guide to some of the biggest worries — and how they might be addressed.\n One way to compare the climate impacts of different vehicle models is with this interactive online tool by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who tried to incorporate all the relevant factors: the emissions involved in manufacturing the cars and in producing gasoline and diesel fuel, how much gasoline conventional cars burn, and where the electricity to charge electric vehicles comes from.\n If you assume electric vehicles are drawing their power from the average grid in the United States, which typically includes a mix of fossil fuel and renewable power plants, then they’re almost always much greener than conventional cars. Even though electric vehicles are more emissions-intensive to make because of their batteries, their electric motors are more efficient than traditional internal combustion engines that burn fossil fuels.\n An all-electric Chevrolet Bolt, for instance, can be expected to produce 189 grams of carbon dioxide for every mile driven over its lifetime, on average. By contrast, a new gasoline-fueled Toyota Camry is estimated to produce 385 grams of carbon dioxide per mile. A new Ford F-150 pickup truck, which is even less fuel-efficient, produces 636 grams of carbon dioxide per mile.\n But that’s just an average.", "date": "NA"}, {"doc_id": "d3", "title": "Don't get fooled: Electric vehicles really are better for the climate ...", "url": "https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2022/11/dont-get-fooled-electric-vehicles-really-are-better-for-the-climate/", "snippet": "Bottom line: Reichmuth’s team compared an average gas-powered sedan (32 miles per gallon) with an average-efficiency EV (300-mile-range battery) and found that the EV reduces total lifetime emissions by 52%.\n “You can also think of it as the manufacturing emissions being a deficit or debt that is sort of ‘paid back’ by emissions savings,” Reichmuth said.\n For the average driver — one who drives about 10,650 miles a year — “there’s a net climate benefit as long as that car’s on the road for two years,” Reichmuth said. “And most of these cars are being driven 10 to 15 years, so it really is a net benefit.”\nMore clean power and innovation are likely to cut pollution from electric vehicle manufacturing\nIn the future, adding more renewables to the power mix and continuing to make other technological advances are likely to help reduce the climate impacts of EV manufacturing.\n “Some of those manufacturing emissions will be helped as we both clean up the grid and clean up transportation,” he said.\n Reichmuth’s research looked at what would happen if car manufacturers switch to using renewable energy at their factories. “If you’re using 100% carbon-free electricity in battery manufacturing,” he said, “it would reduce battery emissions by 27%.”\n Some emissions result from transporting materials from the point of extraction to production facilities, so electrifying the industrial trucking sector would also help improve manufacturing’s climate footprint.\n Verdict: electric cars are already better for the climate than gas-fueled vehicles — but there’s room for improvement.\n ​The transportation sector accounts for about 27% of total U.S. climate-warming pollution, making it the largest contributor to the nation’s emissions.

As more drivers make the switch to electric vehicles, that means a cleaner, healthier future with less global warming emissions.\n In a new analysis, “Driving Cleaner: How Electric Cars and Pick-Ups Beat Gasoline on Lifetime Global Warming Emissions,” the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) shows that switching to electric cars or pickup trucks from comparable gasoline vehicles is one of the most effective ways we can reduce emissions and avoid the worst impacts of climate change. On average, electric vehicles produce less than half the global warming emissions that come from driving a similar gasoline vehicle. This advantage has grown with a cleaner electrical grid and more efficient EV technology. And that advantage holds over the whole lifetime of the vehicle, from manufacture to driving to disposal.\n Transportation is the largest source of global warming emissions in the U.S., and more than half of that pollution comes from passenger cars, trucks, and SUVs. Making the emissions cuts we need to fight climate change means electrifying the cars and trucks that we use to get around.\n “The electric vehicle market is poised to grow dramatically, with more options than ever, from small cars to pickup trucks,” said David Reichmuth, senior vehicles engineer in the Clean Transportation Program at UCS. “This is an exciting moment—and drivers can be confident that by making the switch, they’ll be helping to rein in climate change.”\n Today, the average electric vehicle is so clean that the global warming emissions are the equivalent of driving a car getting 91 miles to the gallon.\n For 90 percent of the country, driving an electric vehicle is cleaner than driving even the most efficient gasoline vehicle. That’s up from two-thirds of the country in 2015—a remarkable improvement in less than a decade, thanks mostly to an increasingly clean electric grid.\n Manufacturers are delivering electric versions of more vehicle models, and that’s especially important for pickup trucks, a growing part of the passenger vehicle market.", "date": "NA"}, {"doc_id": "d6", "title": "Why tech companies are wrong to think electric cars are a solution to ...", "url": "https://www.euronews.com/next/2022/09/19/why-tech-companies-are-wrong-to-think-electric-cars-are-a-solution-to-climate-change", "snippet": "Electric cars are not the solution\nTech companies offer to replace - little by little - vehicles equipped with internal combustion engines, which are considered too polluting, with electric vehicles which have a much lower carbon footprint.\n But lower doesn't mean zero either.\n It’s true that fully electric vehicles do not emit waste products but the batteries that supply energy to the vehicle are made of minerals like lithium and cobalt which have an impact on climate change.\n “In order to create an electric car, a lot of minerals need to be mined and much of that will continue to happen in the global south.

It may be achieved best by shifting from Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) cars to Electric Vehicles (EVs). However, the transition to a low carbon mode of transport will not be instantaneous and any policy or technological change implemented now will take years to have the desired effect. Within this paper we show how on-road emission factors of EVs and models of embedded CO2 in the vehicle production may be combined with statistics for vehicle uptake/replacement to forecast future transport emissions. We demonstrate that EVs, when compared to an efficient ICE, provide few benefits in terms of CO2 mitigation until 2030. However, between 2030 and 2050, predicted CO2 savings under the different EV uptake and decarbonisation scenarios begin to diverge with larger CO2 savings seen for the accelerated EV uptake. This work shows that simply focusing on on-road emissions is insufficient to model the future CO2 impact of transport. Instead a more complete production calculation must be combined with an EV uptake model. Using this extended model, our scenarios show how the lack of difference between a Business as Usual and accelerated EV uptake scenario can be explained by the time-lag in cause and effect between policy changes and the desired change in the vehicle fleet. Our work reveals that current UK policy is unlikely to achieve the desired reduction in transport-based CO2 by 2030. If embedded CO2 is included as part of the transport emissions sector, then all possible UK EV scenarios will miss the reduction target for 2050 unless this is combined with intense decarbonisation (80% of 1990 levels) of the UK electricity grid. This result highlights that whilst EVs offer an important contribution to decarbonisation in the transport sector it will be necessary to look at other transport mitigation strategies, such as modal shift to public transit, car sharing and demand management, to achieve both near-term and long-term mitigation targets.", "date": "NA"}, {"doc_id": "d9", "title": "Methanol: the Surprising Solution for Pollution, Global Warming and ...", "url": "https://www.advent.energy/2019/02/01/htpem-methanol-fuel-cell-electric-car/", "snippet": "Some companies are already producing hybrid buses that feature half the Li-ion battery, no air pollutants, twice the range, a methanol tank, and a range-extender (electrochemical fuel cell).\n The Opportunity and the Problem\nToday, China is leading the transition to electric vehicles accounting for 50% of new vehicles and expected to remain close to 40% in the foreseeable future (1).

However, most people will class an animal as capable of pain if they have a central nervous system and brain. Oysters have neither of these, which has led many to assume that they are not capable of such emotions. While it may be less likely they feel pain compared to animals like dogs, cats, fish, and insects, there is no scientific evidence that proves it.\n Oysters do have a basic nervous system and a small heart and internal organs.

Mouth-watering but verboten.\n Of course, from juicy tomatoes to corn on the cob, I savor summer’s vegetable bounty with everyone else. And there’s another summer staple I eat without guilt: oysters.\n What’s more, even vegans, whose diets forbid animals and animal products like cheese and honey (both of which I permit myself), should feel free to savor oysters “by the boatload.” That goes for mussels, too.\nTechnically, vegans who eat these simple shellfish are “ostrovegans.” Guzzling them isn’t culinary sacrilege, if your goal is to avoid inflicting suffering on animals — not just slaughter but also the fear and discomfort of industrial husbandry’s inhumane confinement. The belief that oysters and mussels can feel pain and discomfort is as rooted in science as the nostrum that you shouldn’t eat the former in months with an “r” in their names.\n Biology suggests that both bivalves are the functional equivalent of plants, without the capacity for pain. They lack what would be considered a central nervous system and brain. Nor can they move on their own. Evolutionists point out that motion and a nervous system are nature’s tools for sensing and moving away from painful stimuli.\n Of course, we can’t be 100 percent sure they don’t feel pain in some way we don’t understand.

It’s troubling to find numerous members in the vegan community supporting the exploitation of animal species based on articles unsupported by a single shred of evidence. More alarming is how these articles try to establish oysters, mussels, and even other animals in the vegan community as being akin to plants, rocks, and as one stated, “a disembodied finger.”\n Modern molecular and taxonomic advances have led scientists to base classification of living beings in very specific ways. I won’t further delve into the subject, but I will say that oysters and other animal species are not comparable to plants. The plant and animal kingdom are separate for good reason regardless of what supporters of bivalve eating in the vegan community will have you believe. One of the most important differences is that plants do not have a nervous system while bivalves do.\n The same bivalve eating individuals claim that mussels and oysters are not sentient because they do not have “brains,” and while it is true that mussels and oyster do not have a brain in the sense that you or I do, they do have ganglia. Ganglia, in simple terms, is basically their form of a brain — how they get their systems to function and respond when they need to. Yes, invertebrates have much simpler nervous systems than vertebrates, but they still have nervous systems. How developed their nervous system depends on the species. More importantly, their form of a nervous system allows them to respond to their living conditions and survive in them.\n “Most, if not all, invertebrates have the capacity to detect and respond to noxious or aversive stimuli.

This is a controversial topic among the vegan community and is not a viewpoint shared by most vegans.\n Keep in mind, also, there are two types of ostrovegans: those who only eat oysters and mussels, versus those who include clams and scallops, as well. Why the difference?\nOysters and mussels are “sessile,” meaning they do not move. Therefore, there is more of a logical reason to believe they do not feel pain. (What would be the evolutionary function of pain in an organism that can’t move away?)\n Clams and scallops are motile, meaning they move around.

As well as this, 95% of oysters in the world are farmed, however, the farming is sustainable and actually doesn’t negatively affect the environment. Oysters purify the water they’re in, taking in CO2 and nitrogen from the atmosphere, meaning they can actually impact the environment positively. As lots of people go vegan for environmental reasons above all, some make an exception for oysters due to its sustainable and environmentally-friendly farming practices.\n But are they really vegan?\n By definition, no, oysters are not vegan; they are still living organisms which means they can’t be considered a vegan food.

The news media hails them as âsuper smart,â and after meeting Chaser, astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson exclaimed, âWho would have thought that animals are capable of this much display of intellect?â So, what are these dogs doing with words?\nLetâs look at the types of words that dogs understand.\nObjects\nDogs can learn the names of many, many, many different objects. Julia Fischer, group leader at the German Primate Centerâs Cognitive Ethology Lab, heard that a Border Collie named Rico knew the names of 70 individual objects, and she wanted to know how Rico mapped specific human words to particular objects. âI contacted the owners, and they let us visit their home and start a study of Rico,â explains Fischer. This culminated in 2004 with an article in Science, reporting that Rico knew the names of over 200 different objects.\n Seven years later, Chaser, a Border Collie in South Carolina, took the gold medal when Alliston Reid and John Pilley of Wofford College reported that Chaser knew the distinct names of 1,022 objects â more than 800 cloth animals, 116 balls, 26 Frisbees, and 100 plastic items.

The canines were successfully trained when they could distinguish between the two objects by consistently fetching the one requested by the owner when presented with both.\n After the training, the scientists then examined the pooches by administering fMRI scans. During the procedure, the doggy’s owner stood directly in front of the dog at the opening of the machine, calling out the name of the toys at set intervals and then holding up the corresponding toys. They also said gibberish words to their dogs and showed them something they hadn’t seen before as a control.\n After analyzing the results, the researchers found that regions of the dogs’ brains responsible for auditory processing were more activated when hearing gibberish words. They believe their findings mean dogs can tell the difference between human words they’ve previously heard and words they haven’t.\n “We expected to see that dogs neurally discriminate between words that they know and words that they don’t,” Prichard said. “What’s surprising is that the result is opposite to that of research on humans — people typically show greater neural activation for known words than novel words.”\n The researchers said the dogs’ brains are more activated by the novel terms, “because they sense their owners want them to understand what they are saying, and they are trying to do so,” the team wrote.\n The researchers did note their findings do not mean spoken words are the most effective way for an owner to communicate with a dog.

They miss you the most when you leave, and are the most excited when you get back, so naturally, you’d want to speak to them. You may often catch yourself in the middle of asking them who wants dinner, not expecting a reply entirely, and then stop and think, “does my dog understand me?”.\n Seeing that they can neither speak back nor understand the vastness of human language, this common question can leave you feeling a little ridiculous- so we’re here to answer it. In short, yes, dogs can understand what we say, but to a certain extent. Allow us to break it down for you.\n When it comes to effective communication, there are 2 factors at play:\nLinguistic content – what is being said\nEmotional content – how it’s being said\nLinguistic content\nAs defined by a vocable, words are essentially just sounds if you take away their meaning, and while dogs may not be able to comprehend all of them, they certainly can set apart a few when they are used frequently.\n This is why it’s possible to train your dog to respond to commands like “sit” and “paw”- they hear the different words, and they know the appropriate action. Thus, in a certain way, they are able to understand its meaning.\n Similarly, you may notice that your dog tends to favour certain words; perhaps “dinner” or “walk” or “treat”. They have associated these frequently used words with the situations that follow, and are able to remember the different things that each one entails. Give it a try with your own dog and watch how they respond.\n In fact, research has shown that the vocabulary of a dog can hold up to 165 words on average, and is quite similar to that of a 2-3 year old in terms of what they can understand.\n This being said, your dog does not understand any particular human language, it is merely able to remember vocables and attach meaning to them.", "date": "NA"}, {"doc_id": "d7", "title": "Can animals understand human language? | HowStuffWorks", "url": "https://animals.howstuffworks.com/animal-facts/can-animals-understand-human-language.htm", "snippet": "Can animals understand human language?\n\"\"\nDo animals really understand what we're saying to them or are they royally duping us?\nMike Watson Images/Thinkstock\nHumans have a special relationship with house pets, and a full 62 percent claim that their pets understand the words that they speak [source: USA Today].

A similar study conducted on another border collie named Chaser went even further; not only could Chaser distinguish the names of at least 1,022 objects, he could also infer the names of new objects [source: Hecht]. For example, if asked to fetch Mr. Monkey -- a toy he had never seen before -- he could locate Mr. Monkey through the process of elimination when the monkey was placed near toys he was familiar with.\n Advertisement\n Perhaps even more exciting, Chaser was able to repeat this process of locating unfamiliar toys by name a full month later, after only being exposed to the new items once before. He was also able to understand verbs and objects used in different contexts; for example, Chaser demonstrated that he could put his nose to a ball, fetch, touch or take the ball depending on the command given.\n Just so you don't think that border collies have an edge, a Yorkshire terrier demonstrated his understanding of more than 120 words in a separate study [source: Hecht].\n But what about other animals who don't have such a close relationship with humans? Consider the case of Kanzi, a bonobo ape. Through years of work with his trainer, Kanzi was able to demonstrate his understanding of more than 3,000 English words [source: Raffaele].

I can assure you that you are still communicating with your dog but in a very different way, through body language. Are you relaxed, excited, frustrated or angry? Is your dog’s demeanor influenced or can you influence it, by your mood? In future, keep in mind what your body language says when you speak to your dog, as it can have a profound effect on the response.\n YOUR WISH IS MY COMMAND Telling a dog what to do by saying a command word, when it has no clue what that is, must be very frustrating to a dog.

Imagine walking into a room with no clue what is expected of you, the only way of knowing you’ve done the right thing is someone saying “Good Dog”.\n For example, I see people say the ‘stay command’ over and over again and then get upset with the dog when it breaks the stay.

Google favors newer content, whether it was recently published or thoroughly updated.\n Content freshness plays an even bigger role if you cover topics that involve news or trends. For such topics, Google prefers pages that provide the latest information.\n For instance, if you’re writing about a global health crisis, you want to publish content that contains recent news and researches.

While there are no particular favorites, here are some types of content that rank well on Google.\n Long-form content: Longer content tends to perform better than shorter content, as it provides more opportunities to incorporate keywords and answer user queries in detail.\n Content that provides value: Google favors content that provides value to users, such as informative articles, guides, tutorials, and reviews.\n Content that answers user queries: Google’s algorithms are designed to identify content that directly answers user queries. So, if your content incorporates long-tail keywords and provides direct answers to specific questions, it has a better chance of ranking higher.\n Content that is well-structured: Well-structured content, including the use of headings, subheadings, bullet points, and numbered lists, can improve the readability and accessibility of your content, making it more likely to rank.\n Content that is optimized for keywords: While keyword stuffing is not recommended and can get you flagged by Google for poor SEO practices, incorporating relevant keywords organically into your content can help it to rank higher on Google.\n Content that is mobile-friendly: Google prioritizes mobile-friendly content because more than half of the traffic comes from mobile. So, it is important to ensure that your website and content are optimized for mobile devices.\n Content that is visually appealing: High-quality images, videos, and infographics can improve the user experience and make your content more engaging and shareable.\n Fresh and updated content: Google rewards websites that regularly publish fresh and updated content.

If you do not index your page in Google, then it will not appear on their search engine results. However, when you successfully index your content, you will automatically get more traffic and any new content you post will be discovered far more quickly.\n Therefore, it is vital that you follow the indexing strategies below to ensure Google evaluates your content:\nEnsure that your most important pages are all indexed.\n Review the index using site:domain.com and eliminate any irrelevant pages, weak content or parameter URLs.\n Review the cache of your key pages using cache:domain.com and check to see if a Googlebot has recently crawled onto your website and discovered your most recent live content.\n Review the content itself.\n Length of the content\nThe ongoing and never-ending debate – how long should quality content be?\n You could ask 100 SEO experts and they would probably all give you a different answer. Some believe that longer content directly correlates with higher search rankings. Whereas others believe that short and sweet caters better for the short attention spans of today’s users.\n However, it’s what Google thinks that really matters, and they have been very clear about how they feel about the importance (or lack of it) when it comes to the word count in evaluating quality content.\n In fact, John Mueller, Webmaster Trends Analyst at Google, revealed in August 2019 that ‘word count is not a ranking factor’.\n Furthermore, the Google Quality Raters do not even count every word of each piece of content, so why are you bothering?\n The amount the content satisfies the user’s query\nThis is arguably the most important element in ensuring that Google ranks your content highly. They are looking for the content that provides the most standout solution to their users’ queries.\n If you provide the best answer for users, Google will rank you highly.

That means longer posts can actually hold your site back in search if they don’t say anything useful.\n Choose Your Target Audience: People, Personas, And Keywords\nYou also need to consider that person’s level of intent as well; are they looking for basic discovery information, or are they trying to buy something right now in as few clicks as possible? Your content will reflect that person and their different stages of user intent.\n Ideally, good content is mapped out before it is even created. It should connect the goals of your website/business and the content you are publishing with the goals of the users looking for it.\n If you’ve done your audience research and still aren’t sure how long your posts should be, you can get a better idea by looking at the content they’re already consuming.\n Search for keywords you want to target and examine the content that shows up on the first page. The length of those blog posts is a good source of insight into what it takes to answer those queries.\n Content should satisfy a user’s search query.

The choice of what queries to rank it for would immediately become obvious, right?\n That’s what semantic keywords do. Add them to ensure that your page doesn’t start showing up for irrelevant searches.\n b) Non-Keyword-Related On-Page Optimization Factors\nOn-page SEO is not just about sprinkling keywords across the page. The factors below help confirm a page’s credibility and authority too:\nExternal links: Linking out to other, relevant pages on the topic helps Google determine its topic further. Plus, it provides a good user experience. How? By positioning your content as a valuable resource.\n Internal links: Those links help you boost rankings in two ways. One, they allow search engines to find and crawl other pages on the site. And two, they show semantic relations between various pages, helping to determine its relevance to the search query better. As a rule, you should include at least 2-4 internal links per blog post\nContent’s length:Long content typically ranks better. That’s because, if done well, a longer blog post will always contain more exhaustive information on the topic, thus keeping a reader on your site longer. That’s called dwell time, and it’s an important ranking factor for the search engines\nMultimedia: Although not a requirement, multimedia elements like videos, diagrams, audio players can signal a page’s quality. It keeps readers on a page for longer just like longer content does. And in turn, it signals that they find the content valuable and worth pursuing.\n 3. Links\nFrom what you’ve read in this guide so far, you know that no page will rank without two factors — relevance and authority.\n In their quest to provide users with the most accurate answers, Google and other search engines prioritize pages they consider the most relevant to their queries but also, popular.\n The first two areas — technical setup and content — focused on increasing relevance (though I admit, some of their elements can also help highlight the authority.)\n Links, however, are responsible for popularity.\n But before we talk more about how they work, here’s what SEOs mean when talking about links.", "date": "NA"}, {"doc_id": "d7", "title": "What Are The Key Benefits to Long-Form Content | Content Creation ...", "url": "https://www.crowdcontent.com/blog/seo/is-long-form-content-the-way-to-go/", "snippet": "2. Longer Visitor Engagement\nIf you post information-rich content that’s worth reading, chances are good that visitors to your site will linger longer and come back more often. This is particularly important when readers reach your site through Google search results because the time spent on your page essentially tells Google that you’ve given searchers what they were looking for, letting Google adjust search rankings for future searches.\n3. Improved Conversion\nForbes notes that companies, such as Crazy Egg, were able to improve their conversion rates significantly by using long-form content. In the case of Crazy Egg, conversion rates increased by more than 30%.\n4. Establishing Your Site as an Authority\nBy providing high-quality long-form content on your blog or website, you bring credibility to your brand. Eventually, this credibility establishes your site or brand as an authority in your industry or subject matter, which can ultimately lead to better name recognition and more online sales.\n5. More Social Media Shares\n According to Search Engine Land, long-form has historically outperformed short-form content when it comes to social media shareability. According to a study conducted by Quick Sprout, posts greater than 1,500 words receive significantly more social shares and likes than shorter posts. The upshot of enhanced social media engagement is new readers and site growth.\n Another benefit of longer content is a higher percentage of backlinks, which can provide more organic traffic. To encourage backlinking, your content should entice link creators to view it as valuable enough to link to or even to use as background information for their own articles.\n Since shorter content, by its nature, provides less information, it’s often considered less valuable, resulting in few, if any, backlinks. Content that takes a deep dive into its subject matter is almost guaranteed to generate more backlinks, which in turn contribute to better search engine rankings.\n Tips for Creating Long-Form Content\nWhile the benefits of long-form content are undeniable, it’s important not to lose focus on quality.

These freedoms support other fundamental rights, such as to peaceful assembly, to participate in public affairs, and to freedom of religion. It is undeniable that digital media, including social media, have bolstered the right to seek, receive and impart information and ideas. Therefore, legislative efforts to regulate free expression unsurprisingly raise concerns that attempts to curb hate speech may silence dissent and opposition.\n To counter hate speech, the United Nations supports more positive speech and upholds respect for freedom of expression as the norm. Therefore, any restrictions must be an exception and seek to prevent harm and ensure equality or the public participation of all. Alongside the relevant international human rights law provisions, the UN Rabat Plan of Action provides key guidance to States on the difference between freedom of expression and “incitement” (to discrimination, hostility and violence), which is prohibited under criminal law. Determining when the potential of harm is high enough to justify prohibiting speech is still the subject of much debate. But States can also use alternative tools – such as education and promoting counter-messages – to address the whole spectrum of hateful expression, both on and offline.\n “Addressing hate speech does not mean limiting or prohibiting freedom of speech.

Generally, however, hate speech is any form of expression through which speakers intend to vilify, humiliate, or incite hatred against a group or a class of persons on the basis of race, religion, skin color sexual identity, gender identity, ethnicity, disability, or national origin. 1\nIn the United States, hate speech is protected by the First Amendment. Courts extend this protection on the grounds that the First Amendment requires the government to strictly protect robust debate on matters of public concern even when such debate devolves into distasteful, offensive, or hateful speech that causes others to feel grief, anger, or fear. (The Supreme Court's decision in Snyder v. Phelps provides an example of this legal reasoning.) Under current First Amendment jurisprudence, hate speech can only be criminalized when it directly incites imminent criminal activity or consists of specific threats of violence targeted against a person or group.\n Hate Crime\nFor the purposes of collecting statistics, the FBI has defined a hate crime as a “criminal offense against a person or property motivated in whole or in part by an offender’s bias against a race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, ethnicity, gender, or gender identity,” including skin color and national origin. Hate crimes are overt acts that can include acts of violence against persons or property, violation or deprivation of civil rights, certain \"true threats,\" or acts of intimidation, or conspiracy to commit these crimes. The Supreme Court has upheld laws that either criminalize these acts or impose a harsher punishment when it can be proven that the defendant targeted the victim because of the victim's race, ethnicity, identity, or beliefs. A hate crime is more than than offensive speech or conduct; it is specific criminal behavior that ranges from property crimes like vandalism and arson to acts of intimidation, assault, and murder.", "date": "NA"}, {"doc_id": "d3", "title": "Hate speech in the United States - Wikipedia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech_in_the_United_States", "snippet": "Hate speech in the United States cannot be directly regulated by the government due to the fundamental right to freedom of speech protected by the Constitution.[1] While \"hate speech\" is not a legal term in the United States, the U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled that most of what would qualify as hate speech in other western countries is legally protected speech under the First Amendment. In a Supreme Court case on the issue, Matal v. Tam (2017), the justices unanimously reaffirmed that there is effectively no \"hate speech\" exception to the free speech rights protected by the First Amendment and that the U.S. government may not discriminate against speech on the basis of the speaker's viewpoint.[2]\nIn academic circles, there has been debate over freedom of speech, hate speech, and hate speech legislation.[3] Other forms of speech have lesser protection under court interpretations of the First Amendment, including commercial speech, \"fighting words\", and obscenity.\n The protection of civil liberties, including freedom of speech, was not written into the original 1788 Constitution of the United States but was added two years later with the Bill of Rights, implemented as several amendments to the Constitution.

If we do not come to the defense of the free speech rights of the most unpopular among us, even if their views are antithetical to the very freedom the First Amendment stands for, then no one’s liberty will be secure. In that sense, all First Amendment rights are “indivisible.”\n Censoring so-called hate speech also runs counter to the long-term interests of the most frequent victims of hate: racial, ethnic, religious and sexual minorities.

As one federal judge has put it, tolerating hateful speech is “the best protection we have against any Nazi-type regime in this country.”\n At the same time, freedom of speech does not prevent punishing conduct that intimidates, harasses, or threatens another person, even if words are used.

And second, the government has historically overused the concept of “national security” to shield itself from criticism, and to discourage public discussion of controversial policies or decisions.\n In 1971, the publication of the “Pentagon Papers” by the New York Times brought the conflicting claims of free speech and national security to a head.", "date": "NA"}, {"doc_id": "d5", "title": "Free Speech Can Be Messy, but We Need It | ACLU", "url": "https://www.aclu.org/news/free-speech/free-speech-can-be-messy-we-need-it", "snippet": "Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me.\n Does anyone as an adult actually believe this?

Respect for the autonomy rights of speakers is a commitment of liberal justice, but it is not the only commitment. When the non-violation of the autonomy rights of speakers foreseeably leads to policies which will violate other, foundational, commitments of liberal justice such as the equal basic rights of citizens, it is unclear that violating the autonomy rights of speakers is unjustified, all things considered. My position here is, I believe, consistent with Rawls’s views about the priority of a coherent scheme of basic liberties. Priority for a scheme of liberties rather than for any one liberty ‘implies in practice that a basic liberty can be limited or denied solely for the sake of one or more other basic liberties, [but never] for reasons of public good or of perfectionist values’ (Rawls (1993, p. 295).\n Having suggested that restrictions on this category of hate speech do not violate unjustly free speech rights, and in light of the obvious harms of such speech, I conclude that this hate speech category is clearly covered as political speech, but nonetheless unprotected and therefore regulable.

The Supreme Court never has created a category of speech that is defined by its hateful conduct, labeled it hate speech, and said that that is categorically excluded by the first amendment. Speech cannot be punished just because of its hateful content. But when you get beyond content and look at context, speech with a hateful message may be punished, if in a particular context it directly causes certain specific, imminent, serious harm — such as a genuine threat that means to instill a reasonable fear on the part of the person at whom the threat is targeted that he or she is going be subject to violence.\n On feeling physically threatened by hateful speech\nNot only threatened.

They consider that the best response to harmful speech is through debate that lets different ideas freely challenge it. Others argue that restrictions on hate speech are vital to the protection of minority communities from the harm that such speech causes.2\nDifferent approaches to what is acceptable speech can be seen around the world. The United States of America has traditionally been a country where the constitutional protection of free speech is vigorously defended.3 And yet, even there, many restrictions on free speech do exist, such as those against speech that incites “imminent lawless action”4 and those that censor obscenity.5\nSome countries show a greater acceptance than others for prohibiting certain forms of speech and even the expression of certain opinions. For instance, some European countries have passed laws in accordance with a European Union Council decision to make it a punishable offence not only to incite hatred, but also to publicly deny crimes of genocide (e.g., the Holocaust) or war crimes.6 In other countries, strict limitations on free speech may go as far as to impose the death penalty for such crimes as apostasy, blasphemy or other statements that may be perceived to be opposed to the dominant religion.7\nIn Canada, various laws at the federal, provincial and territorial levels impose restrictions on the freedom of expression guaranteed by section 2(b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.8 For instance, under the Criminal Code,9 such actions as defamatory libel, counselling suicide, perjury and fraud are prohibited.

The study concludes that while surveillance cameras can be effective in specific contexts such as parking lots and public-transit systems, the potential financial and societal costs require greater research.\n Abstract: “We examine the impacts of public surveillance cameras on crime and disorder in Schenectady, N.Y., a medium-sized city in the northeastern United States.", "date": "NA"}, {"doc_id": "d4", "title": "How a Consumer LPR Company, Homeowners, and Police ...", "url": "https://cops.usdoj.gov/html/dispatch/05-2020/cobb.html", "snippet": "Surprisingly, multiple alerts were sent the first day, and over a six-month period, dispatch handled approximately 900 calls related to the cameras.\n Over time, many arrests were made. After one year, the data collected showed dramatic reductions in crime: reductions of 45 percent in robberies, 45 percent in burglaries, and 62 percent in thefts from autos (compared to a three-year average). Though not all categories lowered this substantially, total crime dropped by 35 percent. Â\n It was clear that the program could be a success in other neighborhoods as wellâand now there was hard data to demonstrate Flock Safety’s effectiveness in reducing crime. But there were remaining challenges to HOA acceptance: privacy concerns and funding.\n Resolving Funding and Privacy Challenges\nTo address privacy concerns, the department worked with county commissioners, HOA leaders, and community groups to determine best practices, gathering input from residents to develop policies and procedures. Most importantly, they made sure that the public knew how the CCPD was using the data and what the CCPD was doing to protect privacy.\n Cost was another matter. Paying for the cameras wasn’t a problem for HOAs and businesses in affluent areas. But high crime rates tend to plague lower socioeconomic areas where funding could be more of a challenge. Â\nRecognizing their value as investigative tools, the Atlanta Urban Area Security Initiative funded a significant part of the cost to provide fixed LPR coverage in those areas, with Cobb County paying for the rest. Â\nTo date, the program has had a great impact on the safety of Cobb County. Officers are getting actionable, lead-creating evidence from the community, resulting in numerous arrests, the locations of missing persons, and the return of stolen property.\n Collaboration and Partnerships Were Key to Success\n Commenting on his department’s unusual collaboration with Flock Safety, VanHoozer says “We don’t promote any vendor.

Researchers found that crime in Glasgow, Scotland, actually increased by 9 percent after cameras were installed there.\n In the United States, one of the most prominent examples was Tampa's use of facial recognition technology in 2001. But the city's police department dropped the technology two years later when it failed to result in a single arrest. The use of video surveillance was considered by the Oakland, Calif., police chief, but he ultimately found that \"there is no conclusive way to establish that the presence of video surveillance resulted in the prevention or reduction of crime. \"\n\"They are good forensic tools — after something happens, they'll tell you what happened,\" said Jim Harper, the director of information policy studies at the Cato Institute. \"And in the rare case where a terrorism case fails, they can be useful to help track down the perpetrators.

The ordinance requirements in some cities mandate that a decal be posted on the passenger windows to make passengers aware that they are under surveillance. Consistent with Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design Theory, would-be perpetrators are less likely to commit a crime while under surveillance.12\nAnother crucial component to ensure optimal performance of security cameras is maintaining cameras according to manufacturer's instructions and not allowing security cameras to be intentionally disabled. Security cameras mandated by ordinance are checked for functioning at yearly inspections organized by city regulators, if not more frequently, when taxicab vehicles are checked for safety. Two of the three taxicab driver homicides that occurred in camera cities in 2010 had disabled cameras in their taxicabs (International Association of Transportation Regulators, personal communication, 2011). Specifically, the only city that experienced an increase in number of homicides after camera installation (City 4) was the city with the two murdered taxicab drivers whose cameras were disabled.\n All six taxicab driver homicides post-installation occurred in camera cities where cameras are required by company policy instead of by city ordinance. Although company policies for security camera installation may be effective, municipal ordinances requiring that all taxicabs be equipped with operating security cameras may be more effective. Such ordinances would ensure that individual owner–operated taxicabs and smaller businesses would use cameras, as do the nationally recognized taxicab companies that make up a large share of the market. Because deterrence through identification is one effect of camera installation, it is important that news reports mention the presence of a camera in the taxicab of a murdered driver, and post photos of potential suspects, so that potential perpetrators are aware of the possibility of being identified by surveillance cameras.\n The lack of an observed reduction in taxicab driver homicides in partition cities was unexpected. Partitions were implemented citywide because of ordinance requirements before 1996 in six of the seven cities examined. These were typically the cities that were experiencing the highest number of taxicab driver homicides,", "date": "NA"}]}

But when my young daughter asked me why not, I didn’t have an answer. So, why can other species like cats, dogs and people vomit but not horses?\n A: This question actually breaks down into two parts: Why is it physically impossible (or at least very difficult) for horses to vomit? And why should that be?\nHorses have a number of key physiological differences to ensure that any food they ingest takes only a one-way trip.\n Vomiting (emesis) is a complex physiological event that requires a closely coordinated sequence of reflexive motions. When you are going to throw up, you draw a deep breath, your vocal cords close, your larynx rises, and the soft palate shifts to close off your airways. Then your diaphragm contracts downward, which loosens pressure on the lower esophagus and the sphincter where it enters the stomach. Next, the muscles of the abdominal wall contract spasmodically, which puts sudden pressure on the stomach. With the upward “doors” open, the contents have a clear exit pathway. All of these separate actions happen involuntarily, of course, controlled by distinct “vomiting centers” in the brain.\n Horses, however, have a number of key physiological differences to ensure that any food they ingest takes only a one-way trip. For example, the muscles of the equine lower esophageal sphincter are much stronger than in other animals, making it nearly impossible to open that valve under backward pressure from the stomach. Also, the equine esophagus joins the stomach at a much lower angle than in many animals, so when the stomach is distended, as with gas, it presses against the valve in such a way that holds it even more tightly closed. And, located deep within the rib cage, the equine stomach cannot be readily squeezed by the abdominal muscles.", "date": "NA"}, {"doc_id": "d2", "title": "Physiology of Vomiting", "url": "http://www.vivo.colostate.edu/hbooks/pathphys/digestion/stomach/vomiting.html", "snippet": "With the pylorus closed and the esophagus relatively open, the route of exit is clear.\n The series of events described seems to be typical for humans and many animals, but is not inevitable. Vomition occasionally occurs abruptly and in the absense of premonitory signs - this situation is often referred to as projectile vomiting. A common cause of projectile vomiting is gastric outlet obstruction, often a result of the ingestion of foreign bodies.\n An activity related to but clearly distinct from vomiting is regurgitation, which is the passive expulsion of ingested material out of the mouth - this often occurs even before the ingesta has reached the stomach and is usually a result of esophageal disease. Regurgitation also is a normal component of digestion in ruminants.\n There is also considerable variability among species in the propensity for vomition. Rats reportedly do not vomit. Cattle and horses vomit rarely - this is usually an ominous sign and most frequently a result of acute gastric distension. Carnivores such as dogs and cats vomit frequently, often in response to such trivial stimuli as finding themselves on a clean carpet. Humans fall between these extremes, and interestingly, rare individuals have been identified that seem to be incapable of vomiting due to congenital abnormalities in the vomition centers of the brainstem.\n Control of Vomition\nThe complex, almost sterotypical set of activities that culminate in vomiting suggest that control is central, which indeed has been shown to be true. Within the brainstem are two anatomically and functionally distinct units that control vomiting:\nBilateral vomition centers in the reticular formation of the medulla integrate signals from a large number of outlying sources and their excitement is ultimately what triggers vomition. Electric stimulation of these centers induces vomiting, while destruction of the vomition centers renders animals very resistant to emetic drugs.", "date": "NA"}, {"doc_id": "d3", "title": "Can Horses Throw Up?

Familiarizing yourself with potential signs of injury or illness allows you to get timely help from a professional veterinarian that could save your horses’ life. One area that is especially important to educate yourself on is the digestive health of your horse.\n Can horses throw up? ​The way a horse’s digestive system is designed makes it nearly impossible for them to throw up, even if they are in extreme intestinal distress. In the rare occurrence that a horse vomits, it is almost always fatal, although there are a few instances where a horse has reached a full recovery after this unlikely event.\n With vomiting being such a common reaction for both humans and other animals, it seems odd that a horse would not have this ability. However, there are several reasons why the horse was designed in this way.\n In this post, we will discuss some of the nitty-gritty details surrounding your horse’s digestive system as well as some of the signs that they may be experiencing a form of intestinal distress.\n Understanding Why Horses Rarely Vomit\nSeveral scientific reasons explain why horses simply cannot vomit. A horse’s digestive system is comprised of several different parts, similar to that of a human. As they swallow their food, it travels down their esophagus where it eventually joins the stomach.\n Located at this intersection is the esophageal sphincter muscle. This muscle relaxes when a horse is eating, allowing food to enter the stomach. Although humans also possess this muscle, it is much stronger in a horse. The strength of the esophageal sphincter muscle, along with the position of the stomach, prevents the valve from opening backward.\n The angle at which the esophagus of a horse joins the stomach is much lower than that of other animals. When your horse experiences indigestion and bloating, the stomach presses up against the valve causing it to remain closed.", "date": "NA"}, {"doc_id": "d4", "title": "Nature curiosity: Why don't squirrels throw up? | Forest Preserve ...", "url": "https://www.reconnectwithnature.org/news-events/the-buzz/nature-curiosity-why-dont-squirrels-throw-up/", "snippet": "The Buzz\nNature curiosity: Why don't squirrels throw up?\nVomiting is one of the most universally dreaded human behaviors. Some people even fear it, a condition called emetophobia. And while vomiting is despised by most, it can be useful in helping rid our bodies of dangerous substances that could otherwise harm us or make us sick.\n Scientists have long known that rodents aren't able to vomit, but the reason behind it has only more recently been understood, according to Smithsonian. In particular, a study into why rodents don't vomit has focused on their brains as well as the anatomy of their digestive systems.\n A 2013 study by University of Pittsburgh neurobiologists on rodents and their inability to vomit investigated their brain stems by giving rodents substances that are known to trigger nausea and vomiting in other animals. The rodents in the study did not exhibit any of the mouth, throat, shoulder and nerve activity normally associated with throwing up, so the researchers concluded the rodents' brains do not have the neurological circuits that allow for vomiting.\n The anatomy of their abdominal area and digestive tract also contributes to the inability to vomit. For example, their diaphragms are weaker than those of other species, and their stomachs are not designed in a way that allows the contents to easily move up through the esophagus, according to the study.\n The inability to vomit isn't necessarily beneficial. In fact, it's precisely the reason rat poison is effective for rodent control. Most mammals, after ingesting a poisonous or toxic substance, will vomit. Rats and rodents cannot, so the poison then quickly kills the animals.\n While most mammals are able to vomit, rodents aren't the only exception. Horses don't throw up either.

These will remain inside the body and put their health at risk and, in some cases, can even lead to death.\n Domestic Horses are more exposed to harmful substances.\n As we have mentioned earlier in this article, when horses are in their natural environment, they will rarely need to vomit.\n But this is not the case with most horses today because they are exposed to toxic substances that would usually not exist in their natural environment.\n Following are some of the risks to which horses are exposed nowadays.\n Animal feed that is intended for other species and contaminated with substances that are toxic to horses, such as cacao by-products or antibiotic additives.\n Poisonous plants, like, for example, oleander and yew.\n Pesticides in the stables and herbicides in the fields.\n Rotting hay and moldy corn.\n Everyone who takes care of horses should know about these risks and make sure they don’t exist in their environment.\n When to Call the Veterinarian\nIf you notice your horse is not feeling well and suspect that he has ingested something toxic, you should not try to solve this on your own. This is an emergency, and you should call your veterinarian immediately.\n Meanwhile, until the veterinarian arrives, you should keep the horse away from the toxic substance and make sure he has fresh water available to drink.\n You should never give your horse anything to make him vomit because this will cause major stomach spasms, which can lead to death.\n How The Vet Can Help The Horse Expel Harmful Substances\nWhen the veterinarian arrives, he will ask you to describe what happened and examine the horse to evaluate the situation’s severity.", "date": "NA"}, {"doc_id": "d6", "title": "Motion Sickness, Trailer Loading Troubles, and Your Horse – The ...", "url": "https://thehorse.com/165668/motion-sickness-trailer-loading-troubles-and-your-horse/", "snippet": "Emesis (vomiting) is also a GI sign of motion sickness, but horses can’t vomit.\n A video you shared shows that your gelding was relatively easy to load but his behavior problems began as soon as the trailer started to move. He scrambled, leaned against the trailer wall and divider, raised his head and pulled back against the lead rope, dropped his hindquarters with legs splayed, and shifted position frequently. After a few minutes he was lathered in sweat. These behaviors suggest that he is struggling to maintain balance, even though the trailer is moving slowly and has nonskid flooring. The balance challenges and possible motion sickness would understandably also make your horse nervous.\n Why do animals get motion sickness?\n Experts don’t know exactly why some animals get motion sickness. A leading theory is that it’s caused by conflicting sensory input from the visual system (eyes), vestibular system (ears), and proprioceptors (joints). One sensory system is telling the horse that its moving, but another system is telling the horse that its standing still; the contradictory signals to the brain cause motion sickness. This would be similar to becoming carsick.\n A second theory is that motion sickness is caused by vehicle movement and the resulting postural instability. This would be like standing up in a small boat on rough seas. Santurtun and Phillips found evidence supporting the second theory2; livestock with motion sickness made persistent efforts to control and stabilize their balance during transport. A horse needs to make adjustments to stay standing upright in a moving vehicle, because the “ground” is unstable. They’ll typically brace themselves by splaying their legs and raising their heads and necks1, which describes your horse’s stance exactly.

Yeast is usually killed off by temperatures higher than 50°C (122°F).\n This temperature is known as the thermal death point, and it varies for different types of yeast. Although yeast can withstand high temperatures for short periods of time, the temperature should not exceed 50°C (122°F) for extended periods of time.\n Temperatures below this point, such as 5°C (41°F) render yeast inactive but don’t usually kill it. If temperatures stay at that freezing level, however, yeast will eventually die. Yeast can also be killed by cold temperatures high above its thermal death point, such as freezing temperatures around 0°C (32°F).\n Is baking yeast poisonous?\n No, baking yeast is not poisonous. In fact, it is commonly used in baking to leaven dough or make it rise. Though it is a living organism, it is not toxic or harmful when ingested and is often consumed in foods such as beer, wine or bread.\n Baking yeast is actually a type of fungus that needs nutrients and sugar to grow.

However, in your case, increasing the amount of yeast was not an option because the dough recipe you used calls for fermenting the dough at room temperature for 18 hours. That is why the amount of yeast in that recipe (around 0.20%) is so small. Anything much greater than that would probably cause overfermentation. Also, the salt level is on the high side. That is typical of what is used with long, room temperature fermented doughs, with a good example being room temperature fermented Neapolitan style doughs. The high level of salt (2.23% in your case) helps control the rate of fermentation (by suppressing yeast performance) so that the dough doesn't ferment too fast.\n After the 18 hours of room temperature fermentation, you might have been able to successfully freeze the dough balls had you kept any further fermentation of the dough to a minimum. Usually, it is only necessary to defrost a frozen dough ball for about a day if kept in the main part of your refrigerator, or less if the dough ball is defrosted at room temperature.", "date": "NA"}, {"doc_id": "d9", "title": "Lion House Rolls Recipe (+VIDEO) - The Girl Who Ate Everything", "url": "https://www.the-girl-who-ate-everything.com/lion-house-rolls/", "snippet": "WHAT TEMPERATURE SHOULD THE WATER BE FOR THE YEAST TO RISE?\n The most common mistake when working with yeast is getting the water temperature right. If your water is too cold the yeast won't activate. If it's too hot it will kill the yeast. Technically the water temperature should be around 116 degrees F. Most people don't measure the temperature.\n Think of the temperature of water if you were to bath a baby. You would want it to be warm enough but not hot.\n How do you know if it worked? If your yeast proofs correctly it should look all foamy. I've noticed it helps to cover the bowl with a towel while it's proofing. If it's not foaming, your yeast is not activated or you killed it. Start over before wasting your ingredients on the rest of the rolls.\n Note: You can freeze shaped rolls for later use. After the first rise, shape the rolls but do not rise again. Instead, place rolls on a baking sheet and immediately place in freezer. When dough is frozen solid, remove rolls from pan and place in a plastic bag, squeeze excess air out of bag and seal. Rolls can be frozen for 3 weeks. To bake after freezing, let rolls rise in a warm place until doubled. This could take up to 2 hours since they are frozen.

As it turns out, freezing temperatures do not kill all the yeast and lactic acid bacteria in a preferment. Some die, but most remain dormant while frozen. The key is to know how to “wake it up” properly and to feed it well so it comes back strong and ready to leaven.\n There are a lot of great reasons to try freezing your sourdough starter. Using a frozen preferment affords an almost instant starter; even with the added thawing and feeding time required, it provides a significant time savings over starting one from scratch. Having a preferment ready to go is convenient—you can freeze it in portions and just thaw what you need—and frees you from a feeding schedule. There’s no need to worry about entrusting someone with your starter when you go on vacation.\n Our experiments demonstrated that a frozen levain will perform well for up to 2 weeks after freezing it. Eventually the ice crystals in the frozen preferment grow big enough to damage the yeasts and bacteria, rendering them useless for leavening. If you have levain that has been frozen for more than 2 weeks, you can still use it in combination with commercial yeast. The less-active levain will still provide your bread with complex flavor, and the yeast makes the dough rise.\n Tips for Freezing Levain\nWorking with frozen levain is simple, although freezing your starter involves more than throwing it in a jar and stashing it in the freezer. Here are a few recommendations to help you get you started.\nTip 1: Freeze your preferment immediately after you make it. Freezing a ripe preferment won’t give the yeast the nutrients it needs because there will be little food left.", "date": "NA"}]}

However, the widely held belief that commercially available computerized brain-training programs improve general cognitive function in the wider population in our opinion lacks empirical support. The central question is not whether performance on cognitive tests can be improved by training, but rather, whether those benefits transfer to other untrained tasks or lead to any general improvement in the level of cognitive functioning.

But does this brain training really work? Recent studies have shown an improvement in different cognitive domains after completing extended periods of mental training. The brain is like a muscle; you should exercise it every day. Brain training is important to keep your mind sharp for a longer period of time, since cognitive decline can be an unavoidable part of aging.\n Which brain games are most helpful?\n There are a variety of activities that could be classified as “brain games,” which are anything that stimulates your brain. Each practice can improve different cognitive functions like memory, problem solving, and critical thinking. Brain games for critical thinking and problem solving include crossword puzzles, chess, Sudoku, or bridge. Mental training can also include creative outlets like drawing, playing an instrument, or learning a new language. Try to find a variety of mentally stimulating activities that you enjoy so you will be more likely to keep up with the activities.\n How often should you practice brain training?\n According to the American Psychological Association, people begin to see cognitive decline in perceptual speed — quickly comparing symbols, figures, or numbers for patterns — beginning in their 20s or 30s. People who participate in brain games for a few hours a week have experienced lasting benefits. Research suggests that once people learn to have better control over their attention and mental processing abilities, they can apply what they learned from the brain games into day-to-day activities.\n What are the benefits of brain games?\nMajor benefits are seen when you practice brain training because this allows for neuroplasticity to work its magic. Neuroplasticity is the ability of the brain to form and reorganize synaptic connections. One of the most researched benefits of mental games is the brain’s working memory, the part of short-term memory that is concerned with understanding concepts and languages faster.

Some intriguing isolated reports do inspire additional research, however.\n In a balanced evaluation of brain games, we also need to keep in mind opportunity costs.

Exercises to strengthen brain function should offer novelty and challenge. “Almost any silly suggestion can work,” says David Eagleman, PhD, a neuroscientist and adjunct professor of psychology and public mental health and population sciences at the Wu Tsai Neurosciences Institute at Stanford University in California. “Drive home via a different route.

In contrast, among those with prior experience, drug–placebo differences were both significant and substantially larger than those reported in other clinical trials, whereas the combined differences for antidepressant-experienced and antidepressant-naive participants are in the same range of other clinical trials. Taken together, the data from both studies strongly suggest that prescriptions for antidepressants should not be given to depressed people who have never taken them before.\n What Is to Be Done?\nHow then shall we treat depression? One suggestion that has been made to me informally is to prescribe antidepressants as active placebos. An active placebo is a pharmacologically active substance that does not have specific activity for the condition being treated. Antidepressant medications have little or no pharmacological effects on depression or anxiety, but they do elicit a substantial placebo effect. Could we not use them as a means of capitalizing on the power of placebo?\n The problem with this suggestion is that treatment decisions need to be based on an assessment of risks, as well as benefits. The risks of antidepressant treatment include suicidal and violent aggressive behavior in adolescents and young adults; stroke, death from all causes, falls and fractures, and epileptic seizures in the elderly; and sexual dysfunction, withdrawal symptoms, diabetes, deep vein thrombosis, and gastrointestinal and intracranial bleeding in everyone else (55–62). One might argue that these risks might be worth taking for an effective treatment of severe depression, but are they worth risking for a treatment that has no benefit at all over placebo for first-time users?\nA second possibility would be to prescribe placebos. They are safe and effective, with relatively few nocebo side effects and no health risks.", "date": "NA"}, {"doc_id": "d8", "title": "Antidepressants: Do They \"Work\" or Don't They? - Scientific American", "url": "https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/antidepressants-do-they-work-or-dont-they/", "snippet": "To do so would risk reducing their profits.\n Some have suggested that critics of antidepressant efficacy should keep quiet and not publicize their work. The reasoning is that if the effectiveness of antidepressants depends in large part on the faith of patients and their doctors, then publicizing the fact that antidepressants appear to have only minimal efficacy as compared to placebos will have the practical effect of harming patients. But this is putting our heads in the sand. The history of medicine is littered with treatments initially thought effective that we now know to be ineffective at best and actually harmful at worst (For example, bloodletting contributed to the death of George Washington). To ignore the evidence, is to return to a pre-scientific form of medicine. In the long run, this will not be beneficial to patients.\n So what’s the bottom line? In clinical practice, many people suffering from depression improve after taking antidepressants. But the evidence indicates that much of that improvement is a placebo response. Antidepressants do work in the sense that many patients in clinical practice show substantial improvement. However, if the standard is efficacy in comparison to placebo, the best available scientific evidence suggests that antidepressants do not work very well. Given their cost and side effects, the psychiatric community and the general public should not be satisfied with antidepressant medications that provide only a marginal benefit over placebo.\n Indeed, as early as 1994, Brown University School of Medicine psychiatrist Walter Brown suggested treating mild to moderately depressed patients with placebos for an initial 4-6 week period, and then switching to active medications if patients did not improve. To surmount ethical concerns, Brown proposed prescribing placebos openly by informing patients that clinical trials showed that many depressed patients improved after being treated with placebos, and asking whether they would like to try a placebo initially. It’s been sixteen years since Brown offered up his radical prescription for harnessing the placebo effect in the treatment of depression. Is it time to fill the prescription?\nABOUT THE AUTHOR(S)", "date": "NA"}, {"doc_id": "d9", "title": "Are Antidepressants Merely Providing a Placebo Effect? | AAFP", "url": "https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2009/0201/ol2.html", "snippet": "Depression is a major health issue associated with morbidity and loss of productivity. In 2007, antidepressants ranked as the top class of medications dispensed in the United States, with an estimated 232.7 million antidepressant prescriptions and an estimated sale of $11.9 billion.1 However, a recent meta-analysis suggests that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) may not be more effective than placebo.2 Selective publication of positive studies appears to have greatly overstated the benefits of these drugs.3\nAlthough we have regularly witnessed apparent benefits of SSRIs and SNRIs in patients with depression, family physicians should also recognize the limitations of data regarding these drugs and call for further research and discussion. Could the dramatic responses to antidepressant medications be a placebo effect in which providers actively listen and patients feel understood, gain insight, believe in their treatment plan, feel motivated to change their lifestyle or social situation, or perhaps some combination?4 Should we reintroduce the N-of-1 trials, in which each patient is their own “study” comparing placebo with active medication over some period of time, in order to identify the small proportion of patients who may benefit from SSRIs or SNRIs?\n The majority of depression studies measure changes in depression scores that have uncertain clinical significance. Remission rates are rarely measured, and most studies are of short duration (often as little as 24 weeks of follow-up). We need to help researchers identify outcome measures that are more meaningful in the primary care setting.\n Perhaps physicians should prescribe SSRIs and SNRIs only after fully disclosing to their patients that the drugs may be acting through the placebo effect and sharing the known side effects.5,6 Clearly, more research is needed.

His column, “Demystifying Therapy,” runs on alternate Wednesdays.\n Psychotherapy as we know it has been around for about a century, and has been continually refined since.\n So why do placebo treatments perform almost equally as well? What is it that actually makes therapy so effective at treating mental illness — and what could a placebo share in common?\n In the 1980s, the National Institute of Mental Health launched the Treatment of Depression Collaborative Research Program, a large-scale randomized control trial that eventually formed the scientific basis for the belief that therapy is effective. The study showed that interpersonal therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy worked equivalently well to antidepressants for reducing the symptoms of depression.\n In the following three decades, psychotherapy — especially short-term, manualized therapy of the kind tested in the study — has exploded in popularity as a front-line treatment for mental illness.\n Still, there’s more to the story.\n A closer look at the NIMH-TDCRP’s results reveals a curious phenomenon: The therapies and antidepressants barely outperform placebo treatment. On the 54 point Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, CBT does, on average, 1.2 points better than a sugar pill combined with weekly meetings with a psychiatrist.\n This is not to say that therapy didn’t work — in all treatment groups, depression symptoms were reduced from severe to mild. Rather, it is to say that there was nothing specifically effective about the psychotherapies: A sugar pill and weekly meetings with a psychiatrist to discuss the effects of the ‘treatment’ were also comparably effective.\n So why is a sugar pill performing on the level of state of the art therapy and antidepressants?

A. H. Walker, and Stephenson Yang of the University of Victoria and the University of British Columbia.[59] Although they were cautious about claiming a planetary detection, their radial-velocity observations suggested that a planet orbits the star Gamma Cephei. Partly because the observations were at the very limits of instrumental capabilities at the time, astronomers remained skeptical for several years about this and other similar observations. It was thought some of the apparent planets might instead have been brown dwarfs, objects intermediate in mass between planets and stars. In 1990, additional observations were published that supported the existence of the planet orbiting Gamma Cephei,[60] but subsequent work in 1992 again raised serious doubts.[61] Finally, in 2003, improved techniques allowed the planet's existence to be confirmed.[62]\n On 9 January 1992, radio astronomers Aleksander Wolszczan and Dale Frail announced the discovery of two planets orbiting the pulsarPSR 1257+12.[45] This discovery was confirmed, and is generally considered to be the first definitive detection of exoplanets. Follow-up observations solidified these results, and confirmation of a third planet in 1994 revived the topic in the popular press.[63] These pulsar planets are thought to have formed from the unusual remnants of the supernova that produced the pulsar, in a second round of planet formation, or else to be the remaining rocky cores of gas giants that somehow survived the supernova and then decayed into their current orbits.

Through measuring the periodic pulses coming from a neutron star, we could see that the pulses would regularly speed up, then return to normal speed, then slow down, and then return to normal speed again, over and over. The fact that these pulses changed with the same period and amplitude told us that there were massive companions in these pulsar systems, and by measuring the pulse timing, we could infer the masses of these companions: they were definitively planets.\n Similarly, we could observe the periodic redshifting and blueshifting of the light from individual stars, which also revealed the presence of massive planets, which “tugged”", "date": "Mar 24, 2022"}, {"doc_id": "d7", "title": "Video: NASA Confirms 5000 Exoplanets - and Counting", "url": "https://science.nasa.gov/resource/video-nasa-confirms-5000-exoplanets-and-counting/", "snippet": "Video: NASA Confirms 5,000 Exoplanets — and Counting\nUsing powerful telescopes, in space and on the ground, astronomers have now confirmed more than 5,000 exoplanets – planets beyond our solar system.

Clarke, who Sessions suggested had led a coup to force his removal, served as acting director until September 1, 1993, when Freeh was sworn in.[20]\n In the dismissal letter Trump stated that Comey had asserted \"on three separate occasions that I am not under investigation\" which was later confirmed by Comey to the Senate while under oath.[29] This is disputed by reporting from multiple news agencies with multiple sources.

Wray resigned before inauguration day last month after the incoming Republican president indicated he would fire him.\n The FBI director leads 37,000 employees across 55 US field offices. They also oversee 350 satellite offices and more than 60 other foreign locations expected to cover almost 200 countries.\n Patel only narrowly cleared the final hurdle, reflecting the deep divisions over his nomination - the last three FBI picks were approved by at least 90 senators.\n Getty Images\nPatel is a fervent Trump supporter and a fellow critic of the the US government's top law enforcement agency\nIn his confirmation hearings, Patel denied keeping a list of \"deep state\" enemies, while playing down controversial past remarks he had made, such as referring to law enforcement officials who investigated Trump as \"criminal gangsters\".\n The 60-name roster includes former President Joe Biden, former Attorney General Merrick Garland and former National Security Adviser John Bolton, among others.", "date": "2025-02-20 00:00:00"}, {"doc_id": "d7", "title": "J.

The report criticized the FBI's (Hoover's) reluctance to investigate thoroughly the possibility of a conspiracy to assassinate the President.[99][100]\nWhen Nixon took office in January 1969, Hoover had just turned 74. There was a growing sentiment in Washington, D.C., that the aging FBI chief should retire, but Hoover's power and friends in Congress remained too strong for him to be forced to do so.[101] Hoover remained director of the FBI until he died of a heart attack in his Washington home, on May 2, 1972,[102] whereupon operational command of the Bureau was passed onto Associate Director Clyde Tolson.

What does that mean?\n Signed,\nJenny L.\nDear Jenny L.,\nMarket capitalization, or market cap, is an investing term used to describe the size of a publicly traded company. It’s based on a simple formula that multiplies the number of shares of stock in a company by its share price.\n Here’s a basic example: Say you have a company with 1,000 shares of stock and each share trades for $10. Then the company’s market cap is $10,000.\n Apple’s $3 trillion market cap is absolutely astounding. The company has more than 16 billion outstanding shares of stock that during the last calendar year traded as high as $181 and as low as $116.\n One thing to remember is that a company’s market cap is always changing, along with its share price. In fact, Apple only temporarily reached its $3 trillion market cap on Jan. 3, 2022, when its share price briefly hit $182.86. Then the share price dropped 85 cents, causing the company’s market cap to close the trading day a few billion shy of $3 trillion. Yep, 85 cents add up quickly when multiplied by a number with nine zeros.\n Nevertheless, Apple is the first U.S. company to reach a $3 trillion valuation. That’s nearly as much as the gross domestic product of neighboring countries Canada and Mexico combined. Not bad for a business started in a garage in 1976.\n When considering which stocks to buy, investors pay close attention to a company’s market cap because it provides two very important pieces of information – a company’s size and its value. Kind of like house shopping when a homebuyer’s first questions are likely, “How big is the house?” and “What’s the asking price?”\nCompanies can also be grouped into categories based on market cap size as shown below.\n Market Capitalization\nCompany Valuation\nMega Cap\nMore than $200 billion\nLarge Cap\n$", "date": "NA"}, {"doc_id": "d6", "title": "Biggest Companies By Market Cap - Stock Analysis", "url": "https://stockanalysis.com/list/biggest-companies/", "snippet": "Biggest Companies by Market Cap\nA list of stocks ranked by market capitalization, updated daily.

One such term is 'public corporations by market capitalization'. This term refers to a list of companies that are publicly traded, ranked by their total market value. This is a crucial concept for traders as it gives them an insight into the financial health and size of a company, which can greatly influence investment decisions.\n Market capitalization, often referred to as 'market cap', is the total dollar market value of a company's outstanding shares of stock. It is calculated by multiplying a company's outstanding shares by the current market price of one share. The companies with the largest market cap are typically considered to be the most stable and secure for investment, with less risk of bankruptcy or financial trouble.\n Understanding Market Capitalization\nMarket capitalization is a key metric in determining the value of a company. It provides an estimate of what a company is worth on the open market, as well as a benchmark for investors to use in comparing the value of different companies. Market cap is often used in financial news and reports to give a sense of a company's size and growth potential.\n While market cap gives a snapshot of a company's value, it's important to note that it doesn't tell the whole story. It doesn't account for a company's debt or other liabilities and it doesn't give any indication of a company's future performance or growth potential. Therefore, while it's a useful metric, it should be used in conjunction with other financial indicators when evaluating a company's worth.\n Calculating Market Capitalization\nCalculating market capitalization is straightforward. It's simply the current share price of a company multiplied by the total number of its outstanding shares.

Swift had already left the label for Republic Records and, according to her 2019 Tumblr post, had begged Borchetta to let her buy back her work.\n He instead told her she could continue to record albums for Big Machine and “earn” her songs back. She refused, and when Borchetta sold, it was to a man Swift said had bullied and gaslighted her for years, partly through his client, West, whom Swift accused of making “a revenge porn music video which strips my body naked.” The rereleases include new songs she wrote for the albums but didn’t include on the original versions, dubbed “From the Vault” releases.

The company’s décor team chooses items that reflect the history and culture of the area where the restaurant is located, meaning the décor in the Bakersfield, California Cracker Barrel will be quite different from that of the store in Wilkes Barre, Pennsylvania. In this way, each restaurant also becomes a local museum of sorts. It’s one more pretty neat reason to seek out a Cracker Barrel while traveling.\n While many of these antiques are unique to a store’s specific area, there are a few items that are universal.

However, there is a significant difference between male and female billionaires: whereas most of the former were “self-made”, close to 40 percent of the latter had inherited their fortune. Furthermore, when looking at the demographics of billionaires globally, only 13 percent were women. Finally, only about 10 percent of the billionaires worldwide were younger than 50 years old. As of March 2025, 20-year-old Clemente Del Vecchio was the world's youngest billionaire.\n While this is not necessarily the industry from which the billionaires earn their fortune, nearly one-fourth of the world's male billionaires devote most of their time to banking and financing. On the other hand, the first industry among female billionaires was non-profit and social organizations. Concerning asset allocation; almost 40 percent of the wealth of male billionaires is derived from public holdings, while the same was the case for only 22 percent of female billionaires.\n The “self-made” billionaire myth\nThe common narrative about “self-made” is that in opposition to billionaires who inherited their fortune, “self-made” billionaires came from nothing and earned their wealth by themselves, working harder than others. However, this narrative fails to take into consideration systemic inequalities. Indeed, most of today's billionaires benefited from their family wealth, privilege, and social connections to start their businesses. And then, their businesses were largely supported by labor exploitation, tax loopholes, and government subsidies.\n This text provides general information.

A riff on pasta gianduja, a chocolate paste invented in Turin during Napoleon's rule (1796-1814, in case you don't have a history book handy) Ferrero's initial creation was something of a chocolate block that could be cut and sandwiched between slices of bread—economical, certainly, but not so appealing. The slab was eventually made spreadable, and the first jar of Nutella left the factory on April 20, 1964. The rest, they say, is history.\n Today, Nutella is the subject of food fandom and worldwide devotion—my own household included. Found on anything from polenta pancakes to—yep—pizza, the spread seemingly knows no limits. Statistically and financially, it's also a marvel: In 2013, you could reportedly circle the globe 1.4 times with the amount of Nutella produced; and in the beginning of 2015, one jar of Nutella was sold, worldwide, every 2.5 seconds. To make the spread comprising sugar, palm oil, hazelnut, cocoa solids, and skimmed milk, the Ferrero Group uses approximately 25 percent of the global supply of hazelnuts.\n And though the world has no shortage of idiosyncratic \"holidays,\" World Nutella Day is actually a real thing. Founded by American blogger Sara Rosso on February 5, 2007, the celebration is now managed by Ferrero and has become a global phenomenon. Want to celebrate the big day?

As with Napoleon's blockade, the onset of the war brought with it food rations, and the supply of cocoa was once again drastically limited. In 1946, Piedmontese pastry chef Pietro Ferrero, inspired by gianduiotti and his chocolatier forefathers, created a thick paste using hazelnuts, sugar, and what little cocoa was available. He shaped the paste into a loaf and named it \"Giandujot.\" But though its low proportion of expensive cocoa arose out of the cost-consciousness of the war years, Giandujot, so dense and thick that it had to be cut with a knife, was still too pricey for a mass audience.\n In 1951, Ferrero revolutionized the industry with the first spreadable version of his sweet loaf: \"La Supercrema.\" According to a BBC interview with Ferrero's grandson, Giovanni Ferrero, the spreadability of La Supercrema meant that \"a small amount went a very long way, helping to break down the perception that chocolate was, as Giovanni puts it, 'only for very special occasions and celebrations like Christmas and Easter.' \"\nThe availability and affordability of La Supercrema turned the chocolate-hazelnut spread into a household staple throughout Italy.

Ever since its origin in the 60s, it's been a hugely successful product - a simple search of \"nutella recipes\" will garner you nearly 25-million results! However, we can't talk about how Nutella came to be without first talking about its tasty (and lesser known) predecessor: gianduja. Without the creation of gianduja, Nutella would have never existed (could you even imagine such a world?)\nGianduja has an interesting origin story, and it was serendipitously created out of ingredient limitations. It first came about in Turin, Piemonte (the chocolate capitol of Italy!) in the early 1800s, when Napoleon blocked all French allies - including Italy - from all trading of goods with the British. The restriction of British supplies included cocoa, and this limitation forced chocolatiers to get a bit creative to stretch their supply. The chocolatiers turned to an ingredient they had in abundance: plentiful hazelnuts from the Langhe mountains, just south of Turin. The chocolate masters created a spread of roughly 70% cocoa and 30% hazelnut paste - and thus, gianduja was born! This also led to the creation of gianduitto - individually-wrapped cocoa hazelnut confections that Turin is now famous for. Fast forward to the 1950s, when World War II left Italy in yet another short supply of chocolate. Chocolatier Pietro Ferrero is credited for adding cocoa butter to the gianduja mixture, which gave it a velvety, creamy consistency. In 1964, the first jar of Nutella was released - and the rest is history. Of course, Nutella isn't the only chocolate-hazelnut spread out there.", "date": "NA"}, {"doc_id": "d7", "title": "Success Is Sweet: Ferrero's Crown Jewel, Nutella, Turns 60", "url": "https://www1.villanova.edu/university/experts/spotlight-detail.html?spotlight=9780", "snippet": "Six decades ago, on April 20, 1964, the first jar of Nutella left Gruppo Ferrero's factory in the Italian town of Alba.

It's hard to imagine the brand's small plastic jars and brightly colored-labels outside of a modern grocery store or breakfast table, but this beloved chocolate-hazelnut spread has a long and fascinating history.\n One of the things you likely didn't know about Nutella is that it was invented in Piedmont, Italy as a solution to wartime food rationing, just after the end of World War II. In 1946, as the availability of cocoa in Europe dwindled, pastry chef Pietro Ferrero created his own chocolate-hazelnut paste product, which he called Giandujot. This paste stretched out smaller quantities of expensive cocoa by combining it with nuts and sugar. It was later tweaked to become a spread called La Supercrema, and by 1961, it went through another adaptation and was first sold under the brand name Nutella.\n However, the concept of Ferrero's chocolate-hazelnut paste long predates World War II, with similar products being made in the same region as far back as the early 1800s. The story of Italy's love for hazelnut paste begins before the country was even united as Italy, which happened in 1861.\n Nutella's Italian origins\nGcapture/Getty Images\nIf you know a little bit about Italian history, it makes perfect sense that Ferrero created Nutella in the Piedmont region.", "date": "Dec 14, 2023"}]}

Mostly selected from the golden \"modern\" jazz music era of 1940s to the 1970s, these recordings captured the great passion and emotion that these musicians spent a lifetime developing.\n Kind Of Blue - Miles Davis\nWhile it is one of the top-selling jazz albums of all time, many consider this to be THE best jazz album of all time. This may be because this unrehearsed recording session from 1959 marks a great turning point in jazz history as well as showcasing the top form of some legendary musicians. Miles showed up to the Columbia recording studio with some rough melodies and chords jotted down on paper and the band proceeded to track each song in one or two takes. That's how Miles liked to do it, he made sure the music was spontaneous and in the moment. This album also marked a departure from the traditional bebop style with songs that are simple melodies over simple chord progressions leaving room for deep improvisational exploration. What a treat it is to listen to time and time again.\n A Love Supreme - John Coltrane\nThis album completely revolutionized the jazz scene in 1965 and even today its influence can be found in many musical styles. Instead of showcasing the complex and dense harmonic language in a post-bop style developed with Miles Davis and Thelonious Monk, Coltrane blows over simpler chords freely with a raw spiritual passion. The four songs on this album convey emotions of anger, joy, sadness, ecstasy, tragedy, and triumph. Many types of artists, such as writers or painters, use this album to inspire energy and passion from within themselves for their art. This album also marked a turning point in Coltrane's playing as he ventured into performing music from its deepest, most spiritual roots rather than from his prior more technical perspective.\n Time Out - Dave Brubeck\nDave Brubeck created a masterpiece that became the first instrumental jazz album to sell over a million copies.

Meanwhile, the record kept selling, and selling and selling. Today, 50 years after it was released, \"Kind of Blue\" remains the bestselling jazz album of all time. More than 4 million copies have been sold, and the album still sells an average of 5,000 copies a week. If you have a jazz album on your shelf, odds are it's \"Kind of Blue.\"\nWhy this album? Out of the thousands of jazz albums ever recorded, why does \"Kind of Blue\" maintain its hold on our imaginations more than any other? The simplest response is to say, because it's beautiful. You won't find many recordings that boast more thoughtful compositions or performances of any higher caliber than the solos and ensemble work of Davis, John Coltrane, Cannonball Adderley, Bill Evans, Wynton Kelly, Paul Chambers and Jimmy Cobb. The music has no weak spots. Or perhaps it's the unthreatening nature of the music: five medium-tempo selections, all played at the level of human conversation. There's nothing in these songs that would scare anyone. On the other hand, there are none of the signposts or road maps that make jazz accessible to listeners—no standards that you can hum, no vocals. And yet, even when you hear this album for the first time, it's like meeting an old friend. It sounds familiar somehow. Even today, at 50, \"Kind of Blue\" sounds, as Quincy Jones puts it, \"like it was made yesterday. \"\n Old yet new, strange but familiar—how can music possess such contrary qualities and still sound coherent? In the case of this album, it's because the music was designed that way. It coheres because it was conceived as a whole. Each cut contributes to the whole (in this sense, it might better be titled \"Kinds of Blue\"). One of the most important elements built in from the start was an open-ended sense of discovery and exploration.

Still, the write-up will tell you what the number one album of the year was. For instance, I randomly picked 1996.

Anthony Beevor, author of Arnhem: The Battle for the Bridges, 1944, said in 2021 that “Market Garden was a very bad plan, right from the start.”\n Elsewhere, historians like James Holland and Al Murray on their podcast We Have Ways of Making You Talk, posit that General Gavin’s decision to hold his American soldiers on the southside of Nijmegen bridge as having significant negative effects on XXX Corp’s advance.\n Others take a different approach.

The operation was an ambitious plan by the Allied forces to capture several key bridges in the Netherlands to create a direct route into Germany and end the war quickly. However, the operation was ultimately unsuccessful, and the proverb “A bridge too far” has come to represent a situation where a goal or objective is overly ambitious, beyond what is realistically achievable, or too difficult to attain. The key points of the proverb “A bridge too far” include:\nAmbition: The proverb reflects the idea of setting overly ambitious goals or objectives that may be difficult or impossible to achieve. It suggests that attempting to reach for something that is too far beyond one’s capabilities or resources may result in failure.\n Realism: The proverb highlights the importance of being realistic and pragmatic in setting goals and expectations. It implies that it is essential to assess the feasibility and attainability of a goal before pursuing it, to avoid reaching for something that is unattainable or unrealistic.\nRisk-taking: The proverb also suggests that taking on risks that are too high or attempting to achieve something that is beyond reasonable risk levels may result in failure or negative consequences. It emphasizes the need to carefully consider risks and benefits in any endeavor.\n Consequences of Overreach: The proverb implies that overextending oneself or a situation beyond reasonable limits may lead to negative outcomes or adverse consequences. It warns against pushing too hard or going too far beyond one’s capabilities or resources, as it may result in failure, setback, or disappointment.\n Lessons from History: The proverb “A bridge too far” originated from the historical context of Operation Market Garden, which serves as a reminder of the risks and challenges of over-ambition and unrealistic goals. It highlights the importance of learning from past mistakes and being mindful of historical lessons when setting goals or pursuing endeavors.", "date": "2025-01-13"}, {"doc_id": "d8", "title": "The statement \"a bridge too far\" was made before the Battle of Arnhem", "url": "https://www.battle-of-arnhem.com/the-statement-a-bridge-too-far-was-made-before-the-battle-of-arnhem/", "snippet": "The statement “a bridge too far” was made before the Battle of Arnhem\nWhoever says “Battle of Arnhem” says “a bridge too far”. The phrase is the title of the book that Cornelis Ryan wrote in 1974 about Operation Market Garden, and it is also the title of the film made by Richard Attenborough in 1977 in response to the book.\n Browning\nMany people think that the expression that Arnhem was “a bridge too far” is the conclusion that was drawn after the Battle of Arnhem. However, that is not true.\n The statement was made a few days before the start of Operation Market Garden by British General Frederick “Boy” Browning. Browning was the commander of the British 1st Airborne Corps. The 1st Airborne Division led by General Urquhart and the Polish Parachute Brigade led by General Sosabowski were part of it.\n The 1st Airborne Division was established by Browning in 1942. It was Browning who invented the maroon-colored berets for the paratroopers. He also had the famous Pegasus logo designed.\n When Browning was informed by the planners of Montgomery about the plans for “his” paratroopers near Arnhem, he was told that the British had to occupy the bridges at Arnhem for two days before they were relieved by the ground troops.\n Browning replied that the paratroopers could last four days. He later admitted to commander Roy Urquhart of the 1st Airborne Division that he had added, “But I think we might be going a bridge too far.”\n The statement was recorded in 1973 by Cornelis Ryan when writing his book about Market Garden, after which the statement took on a life of its own.\n So General Browning was skeptical about the plans with his airborne division. At the same time, he dismissed the (retrospective) criticism that was made of the plans.\n He waved away warnings that German armored units had been seen near Arnhem. He denied that the distance between the landing areas and the bridges over the Rhine would be too far.", "date": "2020-05-23"}, {"doc_id": "d9", "title": "\"A Bridge Too Far\" Meaning, Origin and Examples - 7ESL", "url": "https://7esl.com/a-bridge-too-far/", "snippet": "A bridge too far is a common idiom used within the English language, but for many people its meaning can be confusing.

It signifies a situation where someone has overreached in their goals or aspirations, often leading to failure or a significant setback.\n Examples:\n“His plan to complete the project in a week was a bridge too far; we need more time to do it properly.”\n “Attempting to expand the business internationally without proper research was a bridge too far.”\nOrigin of This Idiomatic Expression\nThe phrase comes from the title of the book and film “A Bridge Too Far,” which recounts Operation Market Garden during World War II, an Allied military operation aimed at capturing key bridges in the Netherlands to facilitate a swift advance into Germany. The operation ultimately failed, as the Allies attempted to capture a bridge at Arnhem, which proved to be “too far” beyond their reach.\n Usage of “A Bridge Too Far”\n In a business context:\n“The proposal to expand into three new markets at once was a bridge too far for the management team.”\n Talking about personal goals:\n“While I appreciate his enthusiasm, trying to run a marathon without proper training was definitely a bridge too far.”\n In a discussion about project planning:\n“The idea of completing the project in just one month is a bridge too far, given the resources we have.”", "date": "2024-10-15 00:00:00"}, {"doc_id": "d10", "title": "For Trump supporters, 'a bridge too far' must be nearby", "url": "https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/2023/06/13/for-trump-supporters-a-bridge-too-far-must-be-nearby/", "snippet": "For Trump supporters, ‘a bridge too far’ must be nearby\nJune 13, 2023 7:00 am\nI often wonder where idioms like “a bridge too far” originate. This phrase comes from the title of the 1974 book of the same name, by Cornelius Ryan. The book tells the story of Operation Market Garden, the Allies’ plan of attack to conquer several bridges in the Netherlands in September of 1944. The goal was to establish a route over the Rhine River for an invasion into Germany.\n The Allies never captured that last bridge at Arnhem, and the mission ultimately failed.\n For Americans who possess apparently unrelenting fealty to former President Donald Trump, the bridges in front of them are also numerous. Trump’s influence, his top position in Republican party politics, relies on a constituency that will seemingly follow him anywhere.\n Trump famously said in January of 2016, “I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, and I wouldn’t lose any voters, OK?”\n In June of 2023, the zombies who support him would apparently applaud such a thing. What would the cadre of elected officials, who desperately want this crowd of voters to see them synonymously with the indicted former president, do? They might claim the NYPD is simply an arm of the evil Democratic Party, or even the sinister Biden campaign, and that arresting their dear leader for murder is merely a political stunt.\n Need to get in touch?\n Have a news tip?\n It sounds ridiculous, but it isn’t. The federal indictment that was released last week, and the arraignment scheduled for Tuesday afternoon, challenges the seriousness of murder. What!? How could an editorial writer write something so offensive? Trump just “mishandled” some paper! All politicians do it!\n First of all, no they don’t. No American, a politician or otherwise, has ever done what Donald Trump is accused of here. He took sensitive, classified, dangerous documents from the White House that he was not authorized to take. That actually does happen with alarming regularity.", "date": "2023-06-13 00:00:00"}]}

The Turks fought fiercely and successfully defended the Gallipoli Peninsula against a massive Allied invasion in 1915-1916, but by 1918 defeat by invading British and Russian forces and an Arab revolt had combined to destroy the Ottoman economy and devastate its land, leaving some six million people dead and millions more starving.\nWorld War I: Global Connections\nAs early as the first week of October 1918, both the Ottoman government and several individual Turkish leaders contacted the Allies to feel out peace possibilities. Britain, whose forces then occupied much of the Ottoman territories, was loath to step aside for its allies, particularly France, which according to an agreement concluded in 1916 would take control of the Syrian coast and much of modern-day Lebanon. In a move that enraged his French counterpart, Georges Clemenceau, Prime Minister David Lloyd George and his cabinet authorized Admiral Arthur Calthorpe, Britain’s naval commander in the Aegean Sea, to negotiate an immediate armistice with Turkey without consulting France. Though Britain alone would engineer the Ottoman exit from the war, the two powerful Allies would continue to grapple over control in the region at the Paris Peace Conference, and for years beyond.\n Negotiations between Calthorpe’s team and the delegation from Constantinople, led by the Ottoman Minister of Marine Affairs Rauf Bey, began at 9:30 on the morning of October 30, 1918, aboard the Agamemnon.", "date": "Nov 5, 2009"}, {"doc_id": "d3", "title": "Collapse of the Ottoman Empire, 1918-1920 - | NZ History", "url": "https://nzhistory.govt.nz/war/ottoman-empire/collapse", "snippet": "The Ottoman Empire\nPage 9 – Collapse of the Ottoman Empire, 1918-1920\n The armistice of 31 October 1918 ended the fighting between the Ottoman Empire and the Allies but did not bring stability or peace to the region. The British were in control of Syria, Palestine and Mesopotamia (Iraq), and British, French and Greek forces stood ready to march across the Bulgarian border and occupy Ottoman Thrace and Constantinople. The Sultan, Mehmed VI, feared he would be deposed. The Allies, however, knew he was a figurehead and hoped that his retention would help ensure post-war stability.\n Stability was badly needed. The Young Turk government led by Enver Pasha had collapsed in the days leading up to the armistice. Enver, Cemal Pasha and Talât Pasha had all fled the country to seek sanctuary in Germany. Across what was left of the empire civil infrastructure, already badly strained by years of war, began to disintegrate. Law and order broke down completely in many places. Simmering ethnic and religious tensions erupted into violence and large numbers of deserters turned to banditry and roamed the countryside. The Allies marched into Constantinople with the intention of taking control of large areas of Anatolia. Their pretext was the restoration of order, but this plan also reflected the terms of the peace settlement they were drafting. It was clear that the post-war Ottoman state would not even cover all of Anatolia. This prospect horrified most Turks, for whom Anatolia was their heartland.\n In November 1919, there seemed to be little the interim Ottoman government could do to stop the Allies. The remnants of the two Ottoman armies destroyed by the final British offensive in Palestine and Syria were slowly reassembling under Mustafa Kemal’s command in Cilicia, north of Aleppo. In Mesopotamia the battered but still intact Ottoman Sixth Army regrouped north of Mosul and awaited orders.", "date": "Jan 13, 2016"}, {"doc_id": "d4", "title": "Milestones to peace: the Armistice of Mudros", "url": "https://blog.nationalarchives.gov.uk/milestones-peace-armistice-mudros/", "snippet": "The armistice was signed on board HMS Agamemnon at Port Mudros, on the island of Lemnos, on 30 October 1918.

Catalogue reference FO 93/110/80\nThe entry of the Ottoman Empire into the war on the side of the Central Powers in November 1914 had greatly extended the geographical scope of the conflict. As well as Anatolia – the area containing what is now Turkey – theatres of war sprang up in North Africa, across the Levant and the Middle East, and in Transcaucasia. This, crucially, cut off trade into the Black Sea: a vital artery for Russia.\n Attempts to knock Turkey out of the war early in 1915 failed. This would have involved taking the Dardanelles straits and the Gallipoli peninsula, providing a quick route to the Turkish capital of Constantinople.\n On the Russian front, in April 1915 the Armenian population of the eastern city of Van rose up against the Ottomans in response to growing violence from the Turkish majority. The Armenians seized the city but were soon besieged. Bitter fighting continued in the area for much of 1915. This led to the forced deportation of virtually the entire Armenian community in eastern Anatolia. The deportation was accompanied by widespread robbery and murder, and culminated in forced marches across the Syrian desert. This policy resulted in death on an extraordinary scale (FO 371/2488).\n The campaigns in North Africa, the Arabian peninsula and the Persian Gulf were largely concluded by the end of 1917.

As it progressed, further independent nations like Bulgaria, Romania, Italy, the Ottoman Empire, China and Japan joined the fighting. Not until 1918 would the war’s end be in sight. In October of that year, an armistice between the Ottoman Empire and the Allies ended fighting in the Middle East. Only days later, the disintegrating Austro-Hungarian Empire signed an armistice with Italy.\n “You bet we were happy yesterday morning to be awoken at 3 o’clock by whistles blowing, guns firing and every kind of noise you could think of announcing the surrender of Germany.

The Allied delegation, led by Supreme Allied Commander Marshal Ferdinand Foch, largely ignored United States President Woodrow Wilson’s Fourteen Points for Peace and left no room for negotiation. The German delegation was given 72 hours to accept the terms, which were purposefully severe to prevent Germany from resuming fighting. These included complete demilitarization, the evacuation of France, Belgium and Alsace-Lorraine (a territory that had been annexed by Germany in 1871 following the Franco-Prussian War), and the immediate release of Allied prisoners of war and interned civilians.\n “Dearest Mother and Dad: If only you all could see how glad everyone in this place is!

During Abdul Hamid II's reign, civilian communications had improved, but the road and rail network was not ready for war.[2] It took more than a month to reach Syria and nearly two months to reach Mesopotamia. To reach the border with Russia, the railway ran only 60 km east of Ankara, and from there, it was 35 days to Erzurum.[2] The Army used Trabzon port as a logistical shortcut to the east.

Austria-Hungary, facing starvation and civil war, signed an armistice agreement thereby splitting the union into several smaller countries and bringing an end to the Hapsburg Empire.

The resulting treaty was a compromise that fully pleased no one—least of all, Germany. The terms were very harsh toward Germany, stating that it was solely responsible for starting the war and requiring it to disarm, to surrender its overseas colonies and to pay massive reparations for the losses suffered by the Allies.

Archaeologists point to the Yangtze River Valley as the place where the early selection for favorable peach varieties probably took place.[54]\nA domesticated peach appeared very early in Japan, in 4700–4400 BCE, during the Jōmon period. It was already similar to modern cultivated forms, where the peach stones are significantly larger and more compressed than earlier stones. This domesticated type of peach was brought into Japan from China. Nevertheless, in China itself, this variety is currently attested only at a later date around 3300 to 2300 BCE.[55]\nIt is also found elsewhere in West Asia in ancient times.[57]", "date": "NA"}, {"doc_id": "d2", "title": "The History of Peaches | Frog Hollow Farm", "url": "https://www.froghollow.com/blogs/news/the-history-of-peaches-frog-hollow-farm-1?srsltid=AfmBOooyFNwz2r-OUQ5Ac6SDlzk4frH1FiIIjRL0dyipkwa7eoXf8qke", "snippet": "From the Farm Box Membership to reoccurring orders of Extra Virgin Olive Oil and Granola, we are happy to send you our items at a weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly delivery rate, whichever works best for you!

The information is vast, but I thought I'd share with you some tidbits about the history of everyone's favorite stone fruit- the PEACH.\n Peaches originated in China, where they are native to northwest China. Archaeologists believe that peaches in China were first domesticated along the Yangzi River, where they have found fossilized peach stones believed to be from 6000 BC. Historians have found peaches discussed in Chinese writings from the 10th century. Of specific importance to Chinese culture was the peach blossom, thought to fend off evil spirits and provide vitality. When traveling between towns, Emperors were preceded by soldiers carrying peach blossoms, and each New Year began with peach blossoms hung on front doors all over the county.\n To this day, China is the world's leading peach producer. China produces half of the world's peaches - 11 million tons of peaches per year, followed by Italy producing 1.5 tons, and then the USA at 1 ton.\n The botanical name for peach is \"Prunus persica\", translated from Latin to \"Present from Persia\", referring to the Persian introduction of the Peach to the Romans. After conquering Persia, Alexander the Great took peach seeds to Europe, marking the introduction of the fruits to Spain and France. In the 16th century, Spanish explorers brought the first peaches to South America; from there, the peach traveled to England, where it became a rare and prized delicacy. It was known that Queen Victoria's favorite treat was a fresh peach after dinner.", "date": "Apr 27, 2017"}, {"doc_id": "d3", "title": "Where did white peaches come from? - Quora", "url": "https://www.quora.com/Where-did-white-peaches-come-from", "snippet": "Peaches came originally from China and the white fleshed peaches are the most popular ones in China today but they have been around as long as ...", "date": "Jul 24, 2021"}, {"doc_id": "d4", "title": "Where Do the Best Peaches Come From? - Serious Eats", "url": "https://www.seriouseats.com/where-do-the-best-peaches-come", "snippet": "I have been on a lifelong search for the perfect peach, one that's so juicy you end up wearing it, one that has a perfect balance between sweetness and acidity. You might think that those of us who celebrate local food would pronounce the peach grown in our backyard the best, but I live in New York City, where there are precious few backyards. But I cannot say in good conscience and all honesty that the peaches grown in neighboring backyards and farms all over New Jersey, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania are the best, either. I certainly eat more than my fair share of local farmers' market peaches from Nemeth Orchards and Stone Arch Farms, but their peaches are not life-changing affairs.\n I have friends from Georgia who claim that the best peaches are grown there (yes, I know that baseball Hall of Famer Ty Cobb was nicknamed the Georgia Peach), but I have tasted many Georgia peaches, and though they can be pretty damn fine, they are not the best. Others say that the best peaches come from South Carolina or Texas or Colorado. They would be wrong as well.\n No, I'm afraid I can say with more than a modicum of certainty that the best peaches come from sunny California. Some would say they come from Frog Hollow in Brentwood, and farmer Al Corchesne grows a mighty fine peach. But the best peaches I have ever put in my mouth come from Goldbud Farms in Placerville, in the middle of California Gold Rush country, and from Honey Crisp Farms in Reedley, just outside Fresno.\n I recently found Honey Crisp peaches at a new farmstand on Martha's Vineyard, and at $6.98 a pound, they were a stone cold bargain. Goldbud's Ron Mansfield and Honey Crisp's Art Lange both have degrees in peachology from the University of California. They employ sophisticated growing and irrigation methods to grow peaches that will make you think you're tasting one for the first time.

At the beginning of the Georgia peach boom, one of Atlanta's major roads was renamed Peachtree Street. But despite its associations with perfectly pink-orange peaches, \"The Peach State\" of Georgia is neither the biggest peach producing state (that honor goes to California) nor are peaches its biggest crop.\n So why is it that Georgia peaches are so iconic? The answer, like so much of Southern history, has a lot to do with slavery — specifically, its end and a need for the South to rebrand itself. Yet, as historian William Thomas Okie writes in his book The Georgia Peach, the fruit may be sweet but the industry in the South was formed on the same culture of white supremacy as cotton and other slave-tended crops.\n Sponsor Message\nPeaches, which are native to Asia, have been growing haphazardly in the United States since they were brought over by Europeans in the 17th century. But it wasn't until the latter half of the 1800s that aspiring horticulturists began to try and grow the peach as an orchard crop. In 1856, a Belgian father-and-son pair, Louis and Prosper Berckmans, purchased a plot of orchard land in Augusta, Ga., that would come to be known as Fruitland. Their intention was to demonstrate that fruit and ornamental plants could become just as important an industry in the South as cotton, which was ruining the soil with its intensive planting.\n Buy Featured Book\nHorticulture slowly became accepted as a gentleman's pursuit. But it wasn't until the end of the Civil War and the abolishment of slavery that the sudden availability of labor gave peaches the perfect opening. After the war, \"fruit growing, which to the cotton planter was a secondary matter, [became] one of great solicitude to the farmer,\" Prosper Berckmans wrote in 1876.", "date": "Jul 21, 2017"}, {"doc_id": "d7", "title": "All About Peaches — Fishers Orchard", "url": "https://www.fishersorchard.com/about-peaches", "snippet": "All About Peaches\nFishers means peaches\nIt is said that the peach originated in China, but for many people in the Upstate, peaches mean Fishers. We’ve been growing peaches since 1930, so we know a thing or two about what it takes to produce a juicy, sweet, mouth-watering peach or nectarine.\n Fishers Orchard sells approximately 50 different peach varieties, as well as nectarines and plums, at its three Greer locations. Fresh peaches are generally available from June until September, but that can vary based on growing conditions.\n Did you know?\nSouth Carolina has a long, storied history with the peach. According to historical records, peaches were found in South Carolina as far back as the late 1600s. Since then, a lot has changed, but South Carolina.\n Today, South Carolina produces the most peaches of any state in the South. Our state ships about 90,000 tons a year compared with Georgia’s 40,000 tons, according to United States Department of Agriculture statistics. Nationwide, the top four states in peach production are California, South Carolina, Georgia and New Jersey. California is a significant producer of both fresh and processed peaches, while South Carolina and Georgia mainly produce fresh peaches.\n Other interesting facts:\nThere are about 18,000 acres of peach orchards in South Carolina.\n More than 200 million pounds of peaches are harvested in South Carolina in a typical year.\n South Carolina has been called “The tastier peach state.”\n Weather is the most important factor in growing peaches. A 1- or 2-degree drop at a critical time can make or break a peach crop.\n Peaches are rich sources of vitamins A and C as well as alpha hydroxy fruit acids.\n How to select the best peaches\nA key thing to remember is that Fishers Orchard peaches are picked at the peak of their sweetness, so they are ready to eat. They won’t become sweeter as they sit around and soften.

Only One Gene Separates Peaches and Nectarines\nAnother interesting peach fact is peaches and apricots are only separated by one gene. The mutation causes apricots to have smooth skin instead of peaches' distinct fuzzy texture.\n Nectarines sometimes appear to have a deeper red color than peaches, which is most likely due to the lack of fuzz that allows the color to come through more. Regardless, other than the one differing recessive gene, peaches and nectarines are genetically identical. Nectarines can even be found growing on the same tree as peaches.\n 4. Georgia Is Known as the \"Peach State\"\nWhen you think of Georgia, you may also think of peaches. But do you know why?\nWhile other states, such as California and South Carolina, also grow peaches, Georgia produces the most high-quality and delicious peaches. Georgia's location and weather provide optimal peach growing conditions by being far north enough to provide enough winter chill but south enough to ensure harvesting can happen on schedule. Peaches are now recognized as the state fruit of Georgia.\n 5. Peaches Originated in China\nA lesser-known fun fact about peaches is they are one of the most ancient domesticated fruits, with theirorigins leading back to China. Peaches are considered very important in Chinese culture as they symbolize fertility and longevity, and the fruit is mentioned throughout Chinese mythology.\n Peach seeds are easy to preserve and transport, which made them a popular item for trading along the Silk Road. Eventually, peaches made their way to America once Spanish conquistadors introduced peaches to North America during the mid-1500s. Peach trees quickly sprouted in Virginia, Georgia and the Carolinas.\n6. There Are Three Categories of Peaches\nPeaches are considered a stone fruit because of the hard pit located in the peach's center. The stone or pit and its relationship to the sweet fruity flesh surrounding it determine how peaches are categorized.", "date": "Mar 15, 2023"}, {"doc_id": "d9", "title": "Peach | Fruit, Description, History, Cultivation, Uses, & Facts", "url": "https://www.britannica.com/plant/peach", "snippet": "The peach fruit develops from a single ovary that ripens into both a fleshy juicy exterior that forms the edible part of the fruit and a hard interior, called the stone or pit, that encloses the seed(s). Of the two ovules in the ovary, usually only one becomes fertilized and develops into a seed. This frequently results in one half of the fruit being slightly larger than the other. The flesh may be white, yellow, or red. Varieties may be freestone types, which have stones that separate easily from the ripe flesh, or clingstones, which have flesh that adheres firmly to the stone. The skin of most ripe peaches is downy or fuzzy; peaches with smooth skins are called nectarines. Most peach varieties produce more fruits than can be maintained and developed to full size. Some shedding of fruitlets takes place naturally, about a month to six weeks after full bloom, but the number remaining may have to be reduced further by hand thinning.\n History and cultivation\nThe peach probably originated in China and then spread westward through Asia to the Mediterranean countries and later to other parts of Europe. The Spanish explorers took the peach to the New World, and as early as 1600 the fruit was found in Mexico. For centuries the cultivation and selection of new varieties of peaches were largely confined to the gardens of the nobility, and large-scale commercial peach growing did not begin until the 19th century, in the United States. The early plantings were seedling peaches, inevitably variable and often of poor quality. The practice of grafting superior strains onto hardy seedling rootstocks, which came later in the century, led to the development of large commercial orchards. Worldwide, the peach is one of the most important deciduous-tree fruits, and China, Italy, Spain, and the United States are major producers.\n Peach trees are relatively short-lived as compared with some other fruit trees.", "date": "Jan 3, 2025"}]}
